To find out how long it takes Lee to finish his book, we need to multiply his average reading time per chapter times 7. 7 * 801 = 5607 seconds. Now we need to convert the answer back to the required format. We need to divide 5607 by 60 with a remainder: 5607 // 60 = 93 minutes. The remainder is 5607 - (93 * 60) = 5607 - 5580 = 27 seconds. 93 minutes is 1 hour and 33 minutes. Thus, the answer is H = 1, M = 33, S = 27\", \"H\": 1, \"M\": 33, \"S\": 27}"
