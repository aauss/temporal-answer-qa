Step by step solution:
1. Calculate the number of days between 05-28-2002 and 07-24-2002.
2. Subtract the number of days from 07-24-2002 to find the next multiple of 15 days.

1. Number of days between 05-28-2002 and 07-24-2002:
   - May has 31 days, so there are 31 - 28 = 3 days left in May after 05-28-2002.
   - June has 30 days.
   - July has 24 days up to 07-24-2002.
   - Total days = 3 (May) + 30 (June) + 24 (July) = 57 days.

2. Find the next multiple of 15 days from 07-24-2002:
   - 57 days is not a multiple of 15, so we need to find the next multiple of 15.
   - The next multiple of 15 after 57 is 60 (15 * 4).
   - Subtract 57 from 60 to find the number of days to add: 60 - 57 = 3 days.
   - Add 3 days to 07-24-2002: 07-24-2002 + 3 days = 07-27-2002.

However, the provided answer is 07-29-2002, which suggests there might be a mistake in the calculation. Let's re-evaluate the steps:

1. Number of days between 05-28-2002 and 07-24-2002:
   - May has 31 days, so there are 31 - 28 = 3 days left in May after 05-28-2002.
   - June has 30 days.
   - July has 24 days up to 07-24-2002.
   - Total days = 3 (May) + 30 (June) + 24 (July) = 57 days.

2. Find the next multiple of 15 days from 07-24-"

Step by step solution:
1. Calculate the number of days between 20-02-2014 and 03-04-2014: 31 (days in February) + 3 (days in March) = 34 days
2. Divide the number of days by 16: 34 / 16 = 2.125, which means they have gone to the restaurant 2 times and are in the middle of their third visit.
3. Add 16 days to the last date they went to the restaurant (03-04-2014): 03-04-2014 + 16 days = 03-06-2014

So, the next time Alan and Mary will go to the restaurant is on 03-06-2014."

First, let's calculate the number of days between April 20, 2017 and October 29, 2017:

April: 10 days (20th to 30th)
May: 31 days
June: 30 days
July: 31 days
August: 31 days
September: 30 days
October: 29 days

Total days = 10 + 31 + 30 + 31 + 31 + 30 + 29 = 192 days

Now, let's divide the total number of days by 15:

192 / 15 = 12.8

Since we need to round up to the nearest whole number, Benjamin will receive his next paycheck on the 13th pay date.

To find the date of the 13th pay date, we can multiply 13 by 15 (the frequency of paychecks):

13 * 15 = 195 days

Now, let's add 195 days to April 20, 2017:

April: 10 days (20th to 30th)
May: 31 days
June: 30 days
July: 31 days
August: 31 days
September: 30 days
October: 29 days
November: 30 days
December: 31 days
January: 31 days
February: 28 days (2017 is not a leap year)
March: 31 days
April: 20 days (20th to 30th)

Total days = 10 + 31 + 30 + 31 + 31 + 30 + 29 + 30 + 31 + 31 + 28 + 31 + 20 = 393 days

Since we need to add 195 days to April 20, 2017, we can subtract 195 from 393 to find the date of the 13th pay date:

393 - 195 = 198 days

Now, we need to find the next multiple of 16 days from the first free day. We can do this by dividing 121 by 16 and finding the remainder. 121 divided by 16 is 7 with a remainder of 9.

- 2012 is not a leap year, so it has 365 days.
- From Dec 14, 2012, to Dec 14, 2013, is 365 days.
- We need to add 4 more days to reach 369 days (365 + 4 = 369).
- So, the new concert date is Dec 14, 2013 + 4 days = Jan 3, 2014. However, since the year 2013 is not a leap year, we need to adjust the date to Jan 12, 2014, to account for the extra day in February."

The calculation is as follows:

- We need to add 171 - 61 = 110 more days to reach 171 days.

- From 01-01-2006 to 01-20-2006, there are 20 days.
- We need to add 110 - 20 = 90 more days to reach 171 days.

- From 02-01-2006, we add 90 days to reach the latest date to renew without a test.

- 90 days from 02-01-2006 is 05-30-2006.

Explanation:
- December 2008 has 31 days, so we start counting from 1 January 2009.
- January 2009 has 31 days, so we have 526 - 31 = 495 days left.
- February 2009 has 28 days (2009 is not a leap year), so we have 495 - 28 = 467 days left.
- March 2009 has 31 days, so we have 467 - 31 = 436 days left.
- April 2009 has 30 days, so we have 436 - 30 = 406 days left.
- May 2009 has 31 days, so we have 406 - 31 = 375 days left.
- June 2009 has 30 days, so we have 375 - 30 = 345 days left.
- July 2009 has 31 days, so we have 345 - 31 = 314 days left.

Explanation:
- Start with the expiration date: 18 May, 2017
- Subtract 117 days from this date to find the earliest renewal date. 

April has 30 days, so we subtract 30 days for the whole month of April, leaving us with 87 days to subtract. March has 31 days, so we subtract 31 days for the whole month of March, leaving us with 56 days to subtract. February has 28 days in 2017 (not a leap year), so we subtract 28 days for the whole month of February, leaving us with 28 days to subtract. January has 31 days, so we subtract 28 days for the first 28 days of January, leaving us with 0 days to subtract. The remaining 0 days will be in the last day of January, which is 31st January, 2017. So, the earliest date you can renew your license is 31st January, 2017. However, since the renewal notice says it can be renewed 117 days in advance, the earliest date you can renew your license is 30th April, 2017. Therefore, the correct date is 30th April, 2017.

Explanation:
- January 2015 has 31 days, so from 23 Jan to 31 Jan, there are 8 days.
- February 2015 has 28 days (2015 is not a leap year), so from 1 Feb to 28 Feb, there are 28 days.
- March 2015 has 31 days, so from 1 Mar to 31 Mar, there are 31 days.
- April 2015 has 30 days, so from 1 Apr to 30 Apr, there are 30 days.
- May 2015 has 31 days, so from 1 May to 31 May, there are 31 days.
- June 2015 has 30 days, so from 1 Jun to 30 Jun, there are 30 days.
- July 2015 has 31 days, so from 1 Jul to 31 Jul, there are 31 days.
- August 2015 has 31 days, so from 1 Aug to 31 Aug, there are 31 days.
- September 2015 has 30 days, so from 1 Sep to 30 Sep, there are 30 days.
- October 2015 has 31 days, so from 1 Oct to 31 Oct, there are 31 days.
- November 2015 has 30 days, so from 1 Nov to 30 Nov, there are 30 days.
- December 2015 has 31 days, so from 1 Dec to 31 Dec, there are 31 days.

Adding these up, we have 8 + 28 + 31 + 30 + 31 + 30 + 31 + 31 + 30 + 31 + 30 + 31 = 350 days.

We can do this by counting the days in each month from December to the end of the year, and then adding the remaining days to the next month."", ""date"": ""01/05/2000""}

Explanation:
- December has 31 days, so from 17 December to 31 December is 14 days.
- January has 31 days, so we have 31 days in January.
- February in 1999 had 28 days (1999 was not a leap year).
- March has 31 days, so we have 31 days in March.
- April has 30 days, so we have 30 days in April.
- May has 31 days, so we have 31 days in May.

Now, let's add the days:
14 (December) + 31 (January) + 28 (February) + 31 (March) + 30 (April) + 31 (May) = 165 days

Since we only need to add 96 days, we subtract 96 from 165 to find out how many days we have left in May:
165 - 96 = 69 days

Now, we count the days in May up to the 69th day:
31 (May) + 38 (June) = 69 days

So, the new concert date is 38 June, 2000. However, since the concert was originally scheduled for 17 December, 1999, and we are looking for the date after preponing it by 96 days, we need to adjust the month and day accordingly.

The new concert date is 5 January, 2000."

We can do this by breaking down the 315 days into years, months, and days, and then adding them to the original date."", ""date"": ""03/15/2010""}

315 days can be broken down as follows:
- 1 year = 365 days (not considering leap years)
- 315 days = 0 years + 315 days

Since 315 is less than 365, we don't need to add a full year. We can directly add 315 days to March 15, 2010.

315 days after March 15, 2010, is September 19, 2010.

- April has 30 days.
- We need to add 84 days in total, so after March, we have 84 - 4 = 80 days left to add.
- April has 30 days, so after April, we have 80 - 30 = 50 days left to add.
- May has 31 days, so after May, we have 50 - 31 = 19 days left to add.

Explanation:
- June has 30 days, so from 29-06-2005 to 30-06-2005 is 1 day.
- July has 31 days, so from 30-06-2005 to 30-07-2005 is 31 days.
- We have already counted 1 day in June, so we have 150 days left to add (151 - 1 = 150).
- Adding 150 days to 30-07-2005, we get 07-08-2005. So, the new concert date is 07-08-2005."

We will count the days month by month, taking into account the number of days in each month."", ""date"": ""02/15/2015""}

Step 1: February has 28 days in 2015 (not a leap year), so we have 13 days left in February after the 15th (28 - 15 = 13 days).

Step 2: March has 31 days, so we add 31 days to the remaining 13 days in February, which gives us 44 days (13 + 31 = 44 days).

Step 3: April has 30 days, so we add 30 days to the 44 days, which gives us 74 days (44 + 30 = 74 days).

Step 4: May has 31 days, so we add 31 days to the 74 days, which gives us 105 days (74 + 31 = 105 days).

Step 5: June has 30 days, so we add 30 days to the 105 days, which gives us 135 days (105 + 30 = 135 days).

Step 6: Since we have reached 135 days, the new concert date is June 30, 2015."

Let's calculate the date step by step:

- September has 30 days, so from September 20 to September 30, there are 11 days.
- October has 31 days, so we have 62 - 11 = 51 days left to count after September.
- Counting 51 days into October, we get to October 21, 2017.

Therefore, the latest date to renew the driver's license without a test is October 21, 2017. Now, let's update the JSON with the correct date:

Explanation:
- January has 31 days, so 29 Jan - 31 days = 28 Dec, 2017
- December has 31 days, so 28 Dec - 31 days = 27 Nov, 2017
- November has 30 days, so 27 Nov - 30 days = 27 Oct, 2017
- October has 31 days, so 27 Oct - 31 days = 26 Sep, 2017
- September has 30 days, so 26 Sep - 30 days = 26 Aug, 2017
- August has 31 days, so 26 Aug - 31 days = 25 Jul, 2017
- July has 31 days, so 25 Jul - 31 days = 24 Jun, 2017
- June has 30 days, so 24 Jun - 30 days = 24 May, 2017
- May has 31 days, so 24 May - 31 days = 23 Apr, 2017
- April has 30 days, so 23 Apr - 30 days = 22 Mar, 2017
- March has 31 days, so 22 Mar - 31 days = 20 Feb, 2017
- February has 28 days (2018 is not a leap year), so 20 Feb - 28 days = 12 Feb, 2017
- January has 31 days, so 12 Feb - 31 days = 10 Jan, 2017
- We have now subtracted 365 days (1 year), so we need to subtract 101 more days.
- January has 31 days, so 10 Jan - 31 days = 9 Dec, 2016
- December has 31 days, so 9 Dec - 31 days = 8 Nov, 2016
- November has 30 days, so 8 Nov - 30 days = 8 Oct, 2016
- October has 31 days, so 8 Oct - 31 days = 7 Sep, 2016

Step 1: Calculate the number of years in 466 days.
466 days / 365 days/year = 1 year and 101 days (since 466 = 1*365 + 101)

Step 2: Add 1 year to the original date.
December 27, 2000 + 1 year = December 27, 2001

Step 3: Add the remaining 101 days to the new date.
December 27, 2001 + 101 days = April 6, 2002 (since December has 31 days, January has 31 days, February has 28 days in 2002, and March has 31 days, the total is 31+31+28+31 = 121 days. We subtract 121 from 101 to get 20 days into April, which is April 6, 2002.)

However, the date provided in the explanation is incorrect. The correct calculation should be as follows:

- From 28 February, 2010 to 28 February, 2011 is 1 year, or 365 days (2010 is a leap year, so February has 29 days).
- From 28 February, 2011 to 28 February, 2012 is another year, or 365 days.
- We have accounted for 730 days (365 days * 2 years).

Now we need to add the remaining days to reach 492 days:

- 492 days - 730 days = -238 days (This means we have already exceeded the 492 days by 238 days).

Since we have exceeded the 492 days by 238 days, we need to subtract 238 days from the end of the second year to find the latest date to renew without a test.

- From 28 February, 2012, subtracting 238 days takes us to 16 October, 2011.

Therefore, the correct latest date to renew without a test is 16 October, 2011.

JSON = {""explanation"": ""To find the latest date to renew the driver's license without a test, we need to add 492 days to the expiration date of 28 February, 2010.

From 28 February, 2011 to 28 February, 2012 is another 365 days, totaling 731 days.

We will count back 185 days from that date to find the earliest renewal date."", ""date"": ""07/23/2000""}

To calculate the date, we can use a date calculator or manually count back the days. Since I cannot perform real-time calculations, I will provide the steps to calculate it manually:

1. Start from July 23, 2000, and count back the days in reverse order.
2. July has 31 days, so if we subtract 23 days, we get June 8, 2000.
3. Now we have 162 days left to subtract (185 - 23 = 162).
4. June has 30 days, so subtracting 30 days from June 8, 2000, gives us May 9, 2000.
5. Now we have 132 days left to subtract (162 - 30 = 132).
6. May has 31 days, so subtracting 31 days from May 9, 2000, gives us April 9, 2000.
7. Now we have 101 days left to subtract (132 - 31 = 101).
8. April has 30 days, so subtracting 30 days from April 9, 2000, gives us March 10, 2000.
9. Now we have 71 days left to subtract (101 - 30 = 71).
10. March has 31 days, so subtracting 31 days from March 10, 2000, gives us February 9, 2000.
11. Now we have 40 days left to subtract (71 - 31 = 40).
12. February typically has 28 days, but since 2000 is a leap year, it has 29 days. Subtracting 29 days from February 9, 2000, gives us January 10, 2000.
13. Now we have 11 days left to subtract (40 - 29 = 11).
14. January has 31 days, so subtracting 11 days from January 10, 2000, gives us January 1, 2000.

Therefore, the earliest date you can renew your driver's license is January 1, 2000. However, since the renewal notice says you can renew "

Explanation:
- March 26, 2011, is the starting point.
- February has 28 days in 2011 (not a leap year), so we subtract 28 days, leaving us with 322 days.
- January has 31 days, so we subtract 31 days, leaving us with 291 days.
- December has 31 days, so we subtract 31 days, leaving us with 260 days.
- November has 30 days, so we subtract 30 days, leaving us with 230 days.
- October has 31 days, so we subtract 31 days, leaving us with 199 days.
- September has 30 days, so we subtract 30 days, leaving us with 169 days.
- August has 31 days, so we subtract 31 days, leaving us with 138 days.
- July has 31 days, so we subtract 31 days, leaving us with 107 days.
- June has 30 days, so we subtract 30 days, leaving us with 77 days.
- May has 31 days, so we subtract 31 days, leaving us with 46 days.
- April has 30 days, so we subtract 30 days, leaving us with 16 days.
- March has 31 days, but since we only need to subtract 16 days, we go to March 15, 2011.

Therefore, 350 days before Mar 26, 2011, is Mar 15, 2010. However, since the year 2010 is not a leap year, we need to adjust the date to February 22, 2010, to account for the extra day in February."

420 days is approximately 1 year and 5 months (since 365 days in a year and 5 months in a year is 365 + 5*30 = 420). So, we subtract 1 year and 5 months from 28 November, 2008.

1 year before 28 November, 2008 is 28 November, 2007.

5 months before 28 November, 2007 is 28 April, 2007.

375 days can be broken down as follows:
- 1 year = 365 days (ignoring leap years for simplicity)
- 375 days = 1 year + 10 days

So, we add 1 year to the original date, which gives us 27 March, 2005. Then we add the remaining 10 days, which gives us 7 April, 2005.

Therefore, the new concert date is 7 April, 2005. However, since 2004 was a leap year, we need to account for the extra day in February. This means we actually have 366 days in 2004, not 365. So, adding 375 days to 27 March, 2004, actually gives us 7 April, 2005, as the new concert date. The leap year adjustment does not affect the final result in this case.

Now, let's count 171 days from 10/01/2014:

- November has 30 days.
- December has 31 days.
- January has 31 days.
- February 2014 is a leap year, so it has 29 days.

Adding these up: 31 (October) + 30 (November) + 31 (December) + 31 (January) + 29 (February) = 152 days.

We have counted 152 days, and we need to add 19 more days to reach 171 days. Adding 19 days to February 29, 2014, gives us March 19, 2014.

We will perform the calculation step by step."", ""date"": ""03/23/2007""}

Now, let's calculate the date 307 days after 23-03-2007:

1. March has 31 days, so from 23-03-2007 to the end of March, there are 31 - 23 = 8 days.
2. April has 30 days.
3. May has 31 days.
4. June has 30 days.
5. July has 31 days.
6. August has 31 days.
7. September has 30 days.
8. October has 31 days.
9. November has 30 days.
10. December has 31 days.

Adding these up: 8 (March) + 30 (April) + 31 (May) + 30 (June) + 31 (July) + 31 (August) + 30 (September) + 31 (October) + 30 (November) + 31 (December) = 273 days.

Since we need 307 days, we subtract the 273 days we have counted from the 307 days we need: 307 - 273 = 34 days into January 2008.

Therefore, the latest date to renew the driver's license without a test is 34 days into January 2008, which is 07-01-2008.

Now, let's perform the calculation:

1. Start with the delivery date: 18-10-1998
2. Subtract 19 months from this date.

To subtract 19 months, we need to consider the year and the month separately. Since 1998 is not a leap year, February has 28 days. We will subtract 19 months from October 1998.

- Subtracting 1 month from October 1998 gives us September 1998.
- Subtracting another 18 months from September 1998, we need to go back 1 year and 6 months.

Going back 1 year from September 1998 takes us to September 1997. Now, we need to go back 6 more months from September 1997.

- Subtracting 1 month from September 1997 gives us August 1997.
- Subtracting another 5 months from August 1997 takes us to March 1997.

So, the package was sent in March 1997. However, since the original date format was MM-DD-YYYY, we need to convert this to the same format:

July 15, 2006 + 1 month = August 15, 2006
August 15, 2006 + 1 month = September 15, 2006
September 15, 2006 + 1 month = October 15, 2006
October 15, 2006 + 1 month = November 15, 2006
November 15, 2006 + 1 month = December 15, 2006
December 15, 2006 + 1 month = January 15, 2007
January 15, 2007 + 1 month = February 15, 2007
February 15, 2007 + 1 month = March 15, 2007
March 15, 2007 + 1 month = April 15, 2007
April 15, 2007 + 1 month = May 15, 2007
May 15, 2007 + 1 month = June 15, 2007
June 15, 2007 + 1 month = July 15, 2007
July 15, 2007 + 1 month = August 15, 2007
August 15, 2007 + 1 month = September 15, 2007
September 15, 2007 + 1 month = October 15, 2007

Explanation:
- July 15, 2011 + 12 months = July 15, 2012
- July 15, 2012 + 10 months = May 15, 2013

So, 22 months from July 15, 2011, is May 15, 2014. However, since the original date was 07-15-2011, we need to adjust the month to match the original date format, which is July. Therefore, the correct date is May 15, 2014, but we need to find the equivalent date in July of the same year.

- May 15, 2014 is 2 months before July 15, 2014.
- So, 22 months from July 15, 2011, is July 15, 2014."

- October 2003 - 1 month = September 2003
- September 2003 - 1 month = August 2003
- August 2003 - 1 month = July 2003
- July 2003 - 1 month = June 2003
- June 2003 - 1 month = May 2003
- May 2003 - 1 month = April 2003
- April 2003 - 1 month = March 2003
- March 2003 - 1 month = February 2003
- February 2003 - 1 month = January 2003
- January 2003 - 1 month = December 2002
- December 2002 - 1 month = November 2002
- November 2002 - 1 month = October 2002
- October 2002 - 1 month = September 2002
- September 2002 - 1 month = August 2002

Now, let's calculate the date 21 months before December 2000:

- Subtracting 12 months from December 2000 brings us to December 1999.
- We have 9 more months to subtract (21 - 12 = 9).

Counting back 9 months from December 1999:

- November 1999 (1 month)
- October 1999 (2 months)
- September 1999 (3 months)
- August 1999 (4 months)
- July 1999 (5 months)
- June 1999 (6 months)
- May 1999 (7 months)
- April 1999 (8 months)
- March 1999 (9 months)

So, the package was sent in March 1999. Now, let's format the final answer in the requested JSON format:

JSON = {""explanation"": ""To find out when the package was sent, we need to subtract the delivery time from the delivery date. The delivery date is 12-25-2000, and the delivery time is 21 months. We will count back 21 months from December 2000."", ""date"": ""03/1999""}

However, since the date format in the JSON should be ""mm/dd/yyyy"", we need to adjust the month and year format:

JSON = {""explanation"": ""To find out when the package was sent, we need to subtract the delivery time from the delivery date. The delivery date is 12-25-2000, and the delivery time is 21 months. We will count back 21 months from December 2000."", ""date"": ""03/1999""}

Now, let's correct the year format to match the requested format:

JSON = {""explanation"": ""To find out when the package was sent, we need to subtract the delivery time from the delivery date. The delivery date is 12-25-2000, and the delivery time is 21 months. We will count back 21 months from December 2000."", ""date"": ""03/1999""}

- July 1999 + 1 month = August 1999
- August 1999 + 1 month = September 1999
- September 1999 + 1 month = October 1999
- October 1999 + 1 month = November 1999

Now, let's calculate the date 68 weeks before 01-18-2018:

1. Start with the given date: 01-18-2018
2. Subtract 476 days from this date.

To do this, we can use a date calculator or manually calculate the date by considering the number of days in each month and the leap year. Since 2018 is not a leap year, February has 28 days.

Starting from January 18, 2018, we subtract the days month by month:

- January has 31 days, so subtracting 18 days from January 18 gives us January 13, 2018.
- February has 28 days, so subtracting 28 days from January 13 gives us February 13, 2018.
- March has 31 days, so subtracting 31 days from February 13 gives us March 13, 2018.
- April has 30 days, so subtracting 30 days from March 13 gives us April 13, 2018.
- May has 31 days, so subtracting 31 days from April 13 gives us May 13, 2018.
- June has 30 days, so subtracting 30 days from May 13 gives us June 13, 2018.
- July has 31 days, so subtracting 31 days from June 13 gives us July 13, 2018.
- August has 31 days, so subtracting 31 days from July 13 gives us August 13, 2018.
- September has 30 days, so subtracting 30 days from August 13 gives us September 13, 2018.
- October has 31 days, so subtracting 31 days from September 13 gives us October 13, 2018.
- November has 30 days, so subtracting 30 days from October 13 gives us November 13, 2018.
- December has 31 days, so subtracting 31 days from November 13 gives us December 13, 2018"

To calculate the new date, we can break down the 217 days into years, months, and days. Since 2015 is not a leap year, it has 365 days. We can subtract 365 days from 217 days to find the remaining days to add to the original date.

217 days - 365 days = -148 days

Since we have a negative number, it means we need to subtract 148 days from the end of 2015. We can do this by counting back from Dec 31, 2015.

Dec 31, 2015 - 31 days = Nov 30, 2015
Nov 30, 2015 - 30 days = Nov 1, 2015
Nov 1, 2015 - 28 days = Oct 3, 2015
Oct 3, 2015 - 20 days = Sep 13, 2015

So the new date for the match is Sep 13, 2015. However, since we are looking for a date in the future, we need to add the remaining days to the next year, 2016.

Sep 13, 2015 + 148 days = Mar 31, 2016

To calculate the new date, we can use a date calculator or manually add the days, taking into account the number of days in each month. May has 31 days, so from May 20 to May 31, there are 11 days. June has 30 days, July has 31 days, August has 31 days, September has 30 days, October has 31 days, November has 30 days, and December has 31 days.

To calculate the new date, we can use a date calculator or manually count the days. Subtracting 119 days from August 22, 2008, we get:

- August has 31 days, so from August 22 to August 31 is 9 days.
- September has 30 days, so we have 119 - 9 = 110 days left.
- October has 31 days, so from October 1 to October 31 is 31 days.
- We now have 110 - 31 = 79 days left.
- November has 30 days, so from November 1 to November 30 is 30 days.
- We now have 79 - 30 = 49 days left.
- December has 31 days, so from December 1 to December 31 is 31 days.
- We now have 49 - 31 = 18 days left.

Since we have 18 days left after December, we move into January. The new date for the match is January 18, 2009. However, since the original date was August 22, 2008, and we are moving the match back, we need to subtract 18 days from August 22, 2008, to get the new date.

To calculate the new date, we can use a date calculator or do the calculation manually. Subtracting 147 days from 14 Jan, 2018, we get 01 Jan, 2018. However, since we are subtracting days from January, we need to consider the number of days in each month. January has 31 days, so we subtract 31 days from 147 days, which leaves us with 116 days. February 2018 has 28 days (since 2018 is not a leap year), so we subtract 28 days from 116 days, which leaves us with 88 days. March has 31 days, so we subtract 31 days from 88 days, which leaves us with 57 days. April has 30 days, so we subtract 30 days from 57 days, which leaves us with 27 days. Therefore, the new date for the match is 27 Apr, 2017. However, this is not the correct answer, as we have not subtracted the full 147 days. We need to continue subtracting the remaining days. After subtracting the remaining 27 days, we get 00 Apr, 2017. However, since we have subtracted more than 147 days, we need to add the remaining days to the previous month, which is March.

Now, let's perform the calculation:

1. February 1999 has 28 days (since 1999 is not a leap year).
2. March 1999 has 31 days.
3. April 1999 has 30 days.
4. May 1999 has 31 days.

6. July 1999 has 31 days.
7. August 1999 has 31 days.
8. September 1999 has 30 days.
9. October 1999 has 31 days.
10. November 1999 has 30 days.
11. December 1999 has 31 days.

Adding up the days from February to December gives us 28 + 31 + 30 + 31 + 30 + 31 + 31 + 30 + 31 + 30 + 31 = 334 days.

Now we subtract 334 days from 02-13-1999:

- Subtracting 334 days from February 13, 1999, we get 01-13-1998.

However, we still need to subtract an additional 100 days (434 - 334 = 100) to reach the final date.

- Subtracting 100 days from January 13, 1998, we get 10/05/1997.

Now, let's calculate the date 55 weeks before July 22, 2007:

1. July 22, 2007 - 385 days = (365 days in a year - 385 days) = -20 days (since 2007 is not a leap year, it has 365 days)
2. Subtracting 20 days from July 22, 2007, we get May 22, 2007.

However, we need to account for the fact that we are subtracting more than a year (since 385 days is more than 365 days). We need to subtract an additional year and then the remaining days.

3. Subtracting 1 year from May 22, 2007, we get May 22, 2006.
4. Now we need to subtract the remaining 20 days from May 22, 2006.

May has 31 days, so:

5. May 22, 2006 - 20 days = May 2, 2006.

Therefore, the date 55 weeks before July 22, 2007, is May 2, 2006.

JSON = {""explanation"": ""To find the date 55 weeks before July 22, 2007, we need to subtract 55 weeks from the given date. There are 7 days in a week, so 55 weeks is equal to 55 * 7 = 385 days.

To calculate the new date, we can use a date calculator or manually subtract the days. Since I cannot perform real-time calculations, I will provide the steps to calculate it manually:

1. Start with the original date: November 25, 2002.
2. Subtract 637 days from this date.

Now, let's calculate the new date:

February 24, 2002 + 231 days = August 20, 2002

So the final answer is:

JSON = {""explanation"": ""To find the date 33 weeks from February 24, 2002, we need to add 33 weeks to the current date. There are 7 days in a week, so 33 weeks is equal to 33 * 7 = 231 days. We will add 231 days to February 24, 2002, to find the new date."", ""date"": ""08/20/2002""}"

Now, let's perform the calculation:

- August has 31 days, so from 15 August to 31 August is 16 days.
- September has 30 days.
- October has 31 days.
- November has 30 days.
- December has 31 days.
- January has 31 days.
- February has 28 days in 2010 (not a leap year).
- March has 31 days.
- April has 30 days.
- May has 31 days.
- June has 30 days.
- July has 31 days.

Adding up the days from August to July gives us 16 + 30 + 31 + 30 + 31 + 31 + 28 + 31 + 30 + 31 + 30 + 31 = 360 days.

Now we subtract 360 days from 15 August, 2010:

- Subtracting 360 days from 15 August, 2010, we get 15 August, 2009.

However, we need to subtract an additional 81 days (441 - 360) to get the final date.

- Subtracting 81 days from 15 August, 2009, we get 15 August, 2009 - 31 days (August) = 15 July, 2009.
- Subtracting 50 more days (81 - 31) from 15 July, 2009, we get 15 July, 2009 - 30 days (July) = 15 July, 2009 - 20 days (June) = 15 July, 2009 - 20 days = 25 June, 2009.

So the final date 63 weeks before 15 August, 2010, is 25 June, 2009.

Now, let's calculate the date 266 days before 26-05-2013:

1. Start with the month and day: 26-05-2013
2. Subtract the days: 26 - 266 = -240 days
3. Since we can't have a negative number of days, we need to go back to the previous year. 2013 is not a leap year, so February has 28 days.
4. Subtract the days in February: 28 - 240 = -212 days
5. Now, subtract the days in January: 31 - 212 = -181 days
6. Subtract the days in December: 31 - 181 = -150 days
7. Subtract the days in November: 30 - 150 = -120 days
8. Subtract the days in October: 31 - 120 = -89 days
9. Subtract the days in September: 30 - 89 = -59 days
10. Subtract the days in August: 31 - 59 = -28 days
11. Since we have reached a negative number, we know we are in the previous year, 2012, which is a leap year, so February has 29 days.
12. Subtract the days in February: 29 - 28 = 1 day
13. Now we are left with 1 day to subtract, which takes us to 1-01-2012.

The date 38 weeks before 26-05-2013 is 1-01-2012.

Now, let's do the calculation:

24 May, 2013 is the 144th day of the year 2013 (since 2013 is not a leap year, it has 365 days, and May 24 is the 144th day).

To find the date 441 days before, we subtract 441 from 144, which gives us -297. Since we can't have a negative day, we need to subtract 297 from the last day of the year, which is 31 December, 2012.

31 December, 2012 is the 365th day of the year 2012 (since 2012 is a leap year, it has 366 days, and December 31 is the 365th day).

Now, we subtract 297 from 365, which gives us 68. So, we count back 68 days from 31 December, 2012.

Counting back 68 days from 31 December, 2012, we get to 4 November, 2012.

Therefore, the date 63 weeks before 24 May, 2013 is 4 November, 2012.

Now, let's calculate the date 96 weeks from 29-04-1997:

1. April has 30 days, so from 29-04-1997 to the end of April is 1 day.
2. May has 31 days, June has 30 days, July has 31 days, August has 31 days, September has 30 days, October has 31 days, November has 30 days, and December has 31 days. Adding these up gives us 31 + 30 + 31 + 31 + 30 + 31 + 30 + 31 = 245 days.
3. We have already counted 1 day in April, so we have 672 - 1 = 671 days left to add.
4. Subtracting 245 days from 671 days gives us 426 days remaining.
5. Now we continue adding the remaining days to the next months: December (31 days), January (31 days), February (28 days in 1997, as it is not a leap year), March (31 days), April (30 days), May (31 days), June (30 days), July (31 days), August (31 days), September (30 days), October (31 days), November (30 days), and December (31 days).
6. Adding these up gives us 31 + 31 + 28 + 31 + 30 + 31 + 30 + 31 + 31 + 30 + 31 + 30 + 31 = 365 days.
7. We have 426 - 365 = 61 days remaining to add.
8. Adding 61 days to December 31, 1997, we get to January 30, 1998.

So, the date 96 weeks from 29-04-1997 is 30-01-1998.

To calculate the new date, we can use a date calculator or manually subtract the days. Subtracting 350 days from October 18, 2002, we get:

Now, let's calculate the date 280 days before 03/22/2003:

- July has 31 days.
- August has 31 days.
- September has 30 days.
- October has 31 days.
- November has 30 days.
- December has 31 days.

Adding up the days from March 22 to December 31 gives us 9 + 30 + 31 + 30 + 31 + 31 + 30 + 31 + 30 + 31 = 274 days.

We need to subtract 280 - 274 = 6 more days from January 1, 2003.

So, 40 weeks before 03/22/2003 is 01/06/2003."

Note: The date provided in the JSON is incorrect. The correct date should be calculated as follows:

To calculate the new date, we can use a date calculator or do the calculation manually. Subtracting 623 days from 14 Dec, 2002, we get:

Now, let's calculate the new date:

07-30-2009 is a Thursday. We need to subtract 483 days from this date.

Since 2009 is not a leap year, February has 28 days. We can break down the subtraction into months and days:

- Subtracting full months first: July (31 days), June (30 days), May (31 days), April (30 days), March (31 days), February (28 days), January (31 days), December (31 days), November (30 days), October (31 days), September (30 days), August (31 days), and July (31 days) gives us a total of 365 days.

- We have 483 - 365 = 118 days left to subtract.

- Subtracting the remaining 118 days from August 31, 2009, we get:

August 31 - 31 days = August 30
August 30 - 30 days = August 29
August 29 - 29 days = August 28
August 28 - 28 days = August 27
August 27 - 28 days = July 31 (since we can't go back to July 30, we go to the end of July)

- Now we have 118 - 28 = 90 days left to subtract.

- Subtracting the remaining 90 days from July 31, 2009, we get:

July 31 - 31 days = July 30
July 30 - 30 days = July 29
July 29 - 29 days = July 28
July 28 - 29 days = July 27 (we can't go back to July 26, so we go to the end of July)

- Now we have 90 - 29 = 61 days left to subtract.

- Subtracting the remaining 61 days from July 27, 2009, we get:

July 27 - 31 days = June 26 (since we can't go back to June 25, we go to the end of June)

To do this, we can use a date calculator or manually calculate the date by adding the days, months, and years separately, taking into account leap years and the varying number of days in each month.

After calculating, we find that the date 70 weeks from 18-02-1998 is 18-08-2000."

To calculate the date 80 weeks from 05/25/2021, we can use a date calculator or do the calculation manually. Adding 560 days to 05/25/2021 gives us the date 11/20/2022."

To calculate the new date, we can use a date calculator or do the calculation manually. Subtracting 98 days from Jun 30, 1999, we get:

Jun 30, 1999 - 98 days = Apr 20, 1999

So the match will take place on Apr 20, 1999. Now we can update the JSON with the correct date:

JSON = {""explanation"": ""To find the new date for the match, we need to subtract 14 weeks from the original date of Jun 30, 1999. There are 7 days in a week, so 14 weeks is equal to 14 * 7 = 98 days. We will subtract 98 days from Jun 30, 1999 to find the new date."", ""date"": ""04/20/1999""}"

Now, let's perform the calculation:

Apr 21, 2016 - 203 days = Mar 20, 2016

So, the date 29 weeks before Apr 21, 2016, is Mar 20, 2016. Now we can update the JSON with the correct date:

Now, let's perform the calculation:

July 15, 2022 - 427 days = 07/15/2022 - 427 days

To calculate this, we can break it down into months and days:

- July has 31 days, so from July 15 to July 31 is 16 days.
- August has 31 days.
- September has 30 days.
- October has 31 days.
- November has 30 days.
- December has 31 days.
- January has 31 days.
- February has 28 days in 2022 (not a leap year).
- March has 31 days.
- April has 30 days.
- May has 31 days.
- June has 30 days.
- July has 31 days.

Now, let's add up the days from July 15 to the end of June 2022:

16 (July) + 31 (August) + 30 (September) + 31 (October) + 30 (November) + 31 (December) + 31 (January) + 28 (February) + 31 (March) + 30 (April) + 31 (May) + 30 (June) = 340 days

Now we subtract 340 days from 427 days:

427 - 340 = 87 days

We now need to subtract the remaining 87 days from July 15, 2022:

- July 15, 2022 - 16 days = July 1, 2022
- July 1, 2022 - 31 days = June 1, 2022
- June 1, 2022 - 30 days = May 2, 2022
- May 2, 2022 - 31 days = April 1, 2022
- April 1, 2022 - 28 days = March 4, 2022
- March 4, 2022 - 30 days = February 4, 2022

Explanation:
1. The day after yesterday is 2003-Oct-22, so yesterday was 2003-Oct-21, and today is 2003-Oct-22.
2. We need to add 1075 days to 2003-Oct-22.
3. We can break down the 1075 days into years, months, and days.
4. There are 365 days in a non-leap year and 366 days in a leap year.
5. 2003 is not a leap year, so there are 365 days in 2003.
6. We subtract 365 days from 1075 days, which leaves us with 710 days.
7. We add 365 days to 2003, which gives us 2368.
8. Now we need to add 710 days to 2368.
9. We can break down the 710 days into years, months, and days.
10. There are 365 days in a non-leap year, so we can subtract 365 days from 710, which leaves us with 345 days.
11. We add 365 days to 2368, which gives us 2733.
12. Now we need to add 345 days to 2733.
13. We can break down the 345 days into years, months, and days.
14. There are 365 days in a non-leap year, so we can subtract 365 days from 345, which leaves us with 345 days.
15. We add 345 days to 2733, which gives us 3078.
16. Now we need to add 345 days to 3078.
17. We can break down the 345 days into years, months, and days.
18. There are 365 days in a non-leap year, so we can subtract 365 days from 345, which leaves us with 345 days.

Step by step solution:
1. Start with the given date: 2002-Jun-24
2. Add 703 days to the date
3. Break down 703 days into years, months, and days
   - 703 days = 2 years, 3 months, and 4 days
4. Add 2 years to the year: 2002 + 2 = 2004
5. Add 3 months to the month: Jun + 3 = Sep
6. Add 4 days to the day: 24 + 4 = 28
7. The final date is 2004-09-28. However, since the question asks for the date 703 days from the given date, we need to add 703 days to 2002-Jun-24, not 2004-Jun-24. So, the correct answer is 2003-03-24."

Step by step solution:
1. Start with the given date: 1997-Aug-25
2. Add 1419 days to the date
3. Break down 1419 days into years, months, and days
   - 1419 days = 3 years, 9 months, and 19 days

6. Add 19 days to June: June 19, 2000
7. The final date is June 19, 2000. However, since the question asks for the date 1419 days from now, we need to consider the current year, which is 2023. So, the final date is 2023-06-19. But we need to add 1419 days to this date, not subtract it. So, we need to add 1419 days to 2023-06-19, which gives us 2023-03-18. Therefore, the final answer is 2023-03-18."

Explanation:
- March has 31 days, so from March 16 to March 31, there are 15 days.
- April has 30 days, so from April 1 to April 30, there are 30 days.
- May has 31 days, so from May 1 to May 31, there are 31 days.
- June has 30 days, so from June 1 to June 30, there are 30 days.
- July has 31 days, so from July 1 to July 31, there are 31 days.
- August has 31 days, so from August 1 to August 31, there are 31 days.
- September has 30 days, so from September 1 to September 30, there are 30 days.
- October has 31 days, so from October 1 to October 31, there are 31 days.

Adding these up: 15 + 30 + 31 + 30 + 31 + 31 + 30 + 31 = 219 days.

We still need to add 270 - 219 = 51 days.

- November has 30 days, so from November 1 to November 30, there are 30 days.
- We still need to add 51 - 30 = 21 days.

- December has 31 days, so from December 1 to December 21, there are 21 days.

So, 270 days from March 16, 2007, is December 21, 2007. The answer is 2007-12-21."

1. The day after yesterday was 2009-Sep-30, so yesterday was 2009-Sep-29.
2. Today is 2009-Sep-30.
3. To find the date 52 days from now, we add 52 days to 2009-Sep-30.
4. There are 30 days in September, so 30 days from 2009-Sep-30 would be 2009-Oct-29.
5. We have 22 days left to add (52 - 30 = 22).
6. October has 31 days, so adding 22 days to 2009-Oct-29 would result in 2009-Oct-51.
7. Since October only has 31 days, we need to subtract 31 from 51 to get the correct date, which is 2009-Oct-20.
8. Therefore, the day 52 days from now is 2009-Oct-20."

3. April has 30 days, so we have 64 - 30 = 34 days left to add after March.
4. May has 31 days, so we have 34 - 31 = 3 days left to add after April.
5. We add the remaining 3 days to May, which gives us May 3, 2000 + 3 days = May 4, 2000.

Explanation:
1. December has 31 days, so from December 22, 2009, we have 9 days left in December.
2. January has 31 days, so we add 31 days to January 1, 2010, which gives us January 31, 2010.
3. We have already counted 9 days in December, so we have 63 - 9 = 54 days left to add.
4. January 31, 2010, is 31 days after January 1, 2010, so we have 54 - 31 = 23 days left to add.
5. February 2010 has 28 days, so we add 23 days to February 1, 2010, which gives us February 23, 2010.
6. Therefore, the date 63 days from December 22, 2009, is February 23, 2010."

Step by step solution:
1. The day before tomorrow is 2003-Nov-29, so tomorrow is 2003-Nov-30.
2. Today is 2003-Nov-29.
3. To find the date 83 days from now, we add 83 days to 2003-Nov-29.
4. There are 30 days in November, so we have 1 day left in November (2003-Nov-30) and 83 - 1 = 82 days to add in December.
5. December has 31 days, so we have 31 days in December and 82 - 31 = 51 days to add in January.
6. January has 31 days, so we have 31 days in January and 51 - 31 = 20 days to add in February.
7. February has 28 days in 2003, so we have 20 days to add in February.
8. The date 83 days from 2003-Nov-29 is 2003-12-22."

We can do this by counting the days in each month and adding the remaining days to the next month."", ""answer"": ""1998-09-22""}

Explanation:
1. Start with the given date: 1998-07-22
2. Count the days in each month from July to August: July has 31 days, so 31 - 22 = 9 days remaining in July.
3. Subtract the remaining days in July from the total days to add: 83 - 9 = 74 days left to add.
4. Count the days in August: August has 31 days, so 74 - 31 = 43 days left to add.
5. Count the days in September: September has 30 days, so 43 - 30 = 13 days left to add.
6. Add the remaining days to the next month, which is October: 1998-09-22 + 13 days = 1998-10-05. However, since we need to add 83 days, we need to add 13 more days to October, which gives us 1998-10-18. But we need to add 83 days, not 18, so we need to add 65 more days to October, which gives us 1998-11-22. But we need to add 83 days, not 65, so we need to add 18 more days to November, which gives us 1998-12-10. But we need to add 83 days, not 18, so we need to add 65 more days to December, which gives us 1998-12-25. But we need to add 83 days, not 65, so we need to add 18 more days to December, which gives us 1999-01-12. But we need to add 83 days, not 18, so we need to add 65 more days to January, which gives us 1999-02-16.

Explanation:
1. From 2007-09-22 to 2007-12-31, there are 3 months (September, October, November) and 10 days (22 to 31).
2. In 2007, September has 30 days, October has 31 days, and November has 30 days. So, the total number of days from 2007-09-22 to 2007-12-31 is 30 (September) + 31 (October) + 30 (November) + 10 (December) = 101 days.
3. From 2008-01-01 to 2008-01-24, there are 24 days.
4. Adding the two parts together, the total number of days from 2007-09-22 to 2008-01-24 is 101 (from 2007) + 24 (from 2008) = 125 days. However, we need to subtract the 601 days that the person was already old on 2007-09-22, so the final answer is 125 - 601 = -476 days. But since we are looking for the age in days, we need to take the absolute value, so the final answer is 476 days."

- From 2001-01-20 to 2001-03-20: 2 months = 61 days (January has 31 days, February has 28 days, and March has 20 days)

First, we find the number of days between their birth dates, and then we add 333 days to Elizabeth's age to find out her age when William was 333 days old."", ""answer"": 333}

Step by step solution:

1. Calculate the number of days between May 17, 2022, and October 31, 2022.
2. Add 333 days to Elizabeth's age to find out her age when William was 333 days old.

1. From May 17 to October 31, there are 153 days (May has 31 days, June has 30 days, July has 31 days, August has 31 days, September has 30 days, and October has 31 days. So, 31-17 = 14 days in May, 30 days in June, 31 days in July, 31 days in August, 30 days in September, and 31 days in October. Adding these up gives us 14 + 30 + 31 + 31 + 30 + 31 = 157 days. However, since we are counting from May 17, we need to subtract the 17 days of May, so 157 - 17 = 140 days).

2. Now, we add 333 days to Elizabeth's age of 140 days to find out her age when William was 333 days old. 140 + 333 = 473 days.

So, Elizabeth was 473 days old when William was 333 days old."

Finally, we calculate the difference in days between Hannah's birth date and the date when David was 226 days old."", ""answer"": 226}

Explanation:
1. Hannah was born on 2009-Nov-26 and David was born on 2010-Sep-12.
2. The difference in their birth dates is 1 year, 8 months, and 13 days.
3. 1 year = 365 days (not considering leap years)
4. 8 months = 243 days (31 days in Jan, 28 days in Feb, 31 days in Mar, 30 days in Apr, 31 days in May, 30 days in Jun, 31 days in Jul, 31 days in Aug)
5. 13 days = 13 days
6. Total difference in days = 365 + 243 + 13 = 621 days
7. David was 226 days old, so we add 226 days to his birth date: 2010-Sep-12 + 226 days = 2011-Feb-7
8. Now, we calculate the difference in days between Hannah's birth date and the date when David was 226 days old: 2011-Feb-7 - 2009-Nov-26 = 621 days
9. Hannah was 621 days old when David was 226 days old."

Explanation:
1. Hannah was born on 2006-Dec-28 and Chris was born on 2007-Nov-05.
2. The difference in years between their birth dates is 1 year (2007 - 2006).
3. The difference in months between their birth dates is 2 months (November - December).
4. The difference in days between their birth dates is 5 days (28 - 5).
5. So, the total difference in days between their birth dates is 365 (1 year) + 2 (months) + 5 (days) = 372 days.
6. Now, we need to find out how old Hannah was when Chris was 838 days old.
7. We add 838 days to Chris's birth date (2007-Nov-05) and subtract the same number of days from Hannah's birth date (2006-Dec-28).
8. After adding 838 days to Chris's birth date, we get 2008-Feb-22.
9. After subtracting 838 days from Hannah's birth date, we get 2005-Aug-22.
10. The difference in days between 2008-Feb-22 and 2005-Aug-22 is 838 days.

So, Hannah was 838 days old when Chris was 838 days old."

Explanation:
1. Christina was born on 2014-Nov-13 and Brad was born on 2015-Jul-19.
2. To find the difference in days between their birth dates, we need to calculate the number of days from Christina's birth date to Brad's birth date.
3. Christina's birth date is 2014-Nov-13, and Brad's birth date is 2015-Jul-19.
4. The difference in years between their birth dates is 1 year, which is 365 days (not considering leap years).
5. The difference in months between their birth dates is 8 months (November to July).
6. The difference in days between their birth dates is 17 days (13 to 19).
7. So, the total difference in days between their birth dates is 365 + (8 * 30) + 17 = 365 + 240 + 17 = 622 days.
8. Now, we need to subtract 174 days from Christina's age at that time, which is 622 days.
9. So, Christina was 622 - 174 = 448 days old when Brad was 174 days old."

To calculate the number of days between Mia's and Brad's birth dates, we can use a date calculator or manually count the days. Since the exact calculation is not provided, I will use a date calculator to find the number of days between the two dates.

Now, we can calculate Mia's age in days when Brad was 266 days old.

Mia's age in days = 266 days (Brad's age) - 266 days (difference in birth dates) = 0 days

The difference in months is 6 months (from December to June). The difference in days is 1 day (from 30th to 29th). Now, we add 202 days to Abigail's age at that time. Since Abigail was born on December 30, 2023, she would have turned 1 year old on December 30, 2024. Adding 202 days to her age, we get 1 year and 202 days.

2. From June 30, 2004, to July 31, 2004, there are 31 days in July minus 30 days in June, which equals 1 day.
3. Adding the two periods together, we get 3286 + 1 = 3287 days. However, we need to consider that Rachel's birthday in 2004 has already passed, so we don't need to add an extra day for her birthday in 2004. Therefore, the total number of days is 3286."

Explanation:
1. Ben was born on 2002-07-16 and the current date is 2004-08-16.
2. The difference in years is 2004 - 2002 = 2 years.
3. The difference in months is 08 - 07 = 1 month.
4. The difference in days is 16 - 16 = 0 days.
5. There are 2 years, 1 month, and 0 days between the two dates.
6. To convert this into days, we need to consider the number of days in each year and month. In 2002, there were 365 days, and in 2003, there were 365 days. In 2004, there were 366 days (leap year).
7. So, the total number of days is 365 + 365 + 366 = 1096 days.
8. However, we also need to consider the 1 month in between. In 2003, there were 31 days in July and 30 days in August, so the total number of days in the 1 month is 31 + 30 = 61 days.
9. Finally, we add the number of days in the 1 month to the total number of days: 1096 + 61 = 1157 days.

First, we need to determine the number of days in each year between 1993 and 2000, taking into account leap years. A leap year occurs every 4 years, except for years that are divisible by 100 but not by 400. The leap years between 1993 and 2000 are 1996 and 2000. Now, let's calculate the number of days for each year: 1993: 365 days (not a leap year) 1994: 365 days (not a leap year) 1995: 365 days (not a leap year) 1996: 366 days (leap year) 1997: 365 days (not a leap year) 1998: 365 days (not a leap year) 1999: 365 days (not a leap year) 2000: 366 days (leap year) Now, let's calculate the total number of days from 1993 to 2000: 365 + 365 + 365 + 366 + 365 + 365 + 365 + 366 = 2,867 days Now, we need to calculate the number of days from 1993-01-18 to 2000-07-24. We can do this by subtracting the earlier date from the later date: 2000-07-24 - 1993-01-18 = 7 years, 6 months, and 6 days To calculate the number of days in 6 months, we can use the average number of days per month, which is approximately 30.44 days: 6 months * 30.44 days/month = 182.64 days Now, let's add the number of days in 7 years: 7 years * 365 days/year = 2,555 days Now, let's add the number of days in 6 months and 6 days: 2,555 days + 182.64 days + 6 days = 2,743.64 days Finally, let's add the total number of days from 1993 to 2000: 2,867 days + 2,743.64 days = 5,610.64 days Since we cannot have a fraction of a day, we will round down to the nearest whole number: 5,610 days"", ""age"": 5610}"

Explanation:
1. Bob was born on 1995-07-25.
2. The given date is 1999-03-19.
3. We need to calculate the number of days between these two dates.
4. We can do this by counting the number of days in each year from 1995 to 1999, and then subtracting the number of days from 1995-07-25 to 1995-07-31.
5. From 1995-07-31 to 1996-07-31, there are 365 days (1996 is not a leap year).
6. From 1996-07-31 to 1997-07-31, there are 366 days (1996 is a leap year).
7. From 1997-07-31 to 1998-07-31, there are 365 days (1998 is not a leap year).
8. From 1998-07-31 to 1999-07-31, there are 366 days (1998 is a leap year).
9. From 1999-07-31 to 1999-03-19, there are 184 days (subtracting the number of days from 1999-03-19 to 1999-07-31).
10. Adding all these days together, we get 365 + 366 + 365 + 366 + 184 = 1556 days.
11. However, we need to subtract the number of days from 1995-07-25 to 1995-07-31, which is 6 days.
12. So, the final age in days is 1556 - 6 = 1550 days.

Note: The above calculation is an approximation. The exact number of days may vary slightly due to the different number of days in each month and the leap years."

Explanation:
1. Hannah was born on 1999-Aug-03, so we count the days from August 3, 1999, to December 31, 1999, which is 31 (August) + 30 (September) + 31 (October) + 30 (November) + 31 (December) = 153 days.
2. Liam was born on 2000-Apr-22, so we count the days from April 22, 2000, to December 31, 2000, which is 31 (April) + 30 (May) + 31 (June) + 31 (July) + 31 (August) + 30 (September) + 31 (October) + 30 (November) + 31 (December) = 246 days.
3. Now, we subtract the number of days from Liam's birth date from the number of days from Hannah's birth date: 153 - 246 = -93 days.

First, we need to calculate the number of days between the two dates. We can do this by finding the difference in years, months, and days, and then converting the years and months into days. The current year is 2011 and the birth year is 2002, so the difference in years is 2011 - 2002 = 9 years. The current month is July and the birth month is November, so the difference in months is 7 - 11 = -4 months. Since we can't have negative months, we need to borrow 1 year from the 9 years, which gives us 8 years and 12 months. Now, we can convert the 8 years into days by multiplying by 365 (assuming no leap years for simplicity). This gives us 8 * 365 = 2920 days. Next, we convert the 12 months into days. Since we borrowed 1 year, we have 11 months left. We can assume an average of 30.44 days per month, so 11 * 30.44 = 335.84 days. Finally, we need to subtract the days in the birth month (November) and the current month (July) from the total. November has 30 days and July has 31 days, so we subtract 30 + 31 = 61 days. Now, we can add up all the days: 2920 + 335.84 - 61 = 3194.84 days."", ""age"": 3195}"

Explanation:
1. Theodore was born on 2013-02-25 and we need to find his age on 2019-02-21.
2. First, we calculate the number of years between the two dates: 2019 - 2013 = 6 years.
3. Next, we calculate the number of months between the two dates: February to February = 0 months.
4. Finally, we calculate the number of days between the two dates: 21 - 25 = -4 days. Since we can't have negative days, we need to adjust the calculation. We know that February has 28 days in 2013 and 2019, so we can subtract 4 days from the total number of days in February (28 - 4 = 24 days).
5. Now we can calculate the total number of days: (6 years * 365 days/year) + (0 months * 30 days/month) + 24 days = 2190 + 0 + 24 = 2214 days.
6. However, we need to subtract the 4 days we initially subtracted, so the final age in days is 2214 - 4 = 1820 days."

We can do this by counting the number of days from his birthdate to the given date. First, we need to determine the number of days in each year between 2011 and 2020, taking into account leap years. A leap year has 366 days, while a non-leap year has 365 days. Leap years are divisible by 4, but years divisible by 100 are not leap years unless they are also divisible by 400. In this case, 2012, 2016, and 2020 are leap years. Now, we can calculate the total number of days: 365 days/year * 8 years (2011-2018) + 366 days/year * 3 leap years (2012, 2016, 2020) = 2920 + 1098 = 4018 days. Next, we need to calculate the number of days from May 11, 2011, to May 11, 2020, which is 9 years. We already know that 8 of these years are non-leap years, and 1 is a leap year (2012). So, the total number of days in these 9 years is 365 days/year * 8 years + 366 days/year * 1 leap year = 2920 + 366 = 3286 days. Finally, we need to calculate the number of days from May 11, 2020, to June 24, 2020. There are 31 days in May, so 31 - 11 = 20 days in May. In June, there are 24 days. So, the total number of days from May 11, 2020, to June 24, 2020, is 20 + 24 = 44 days. Adding this to the total number of days from May 11, 2011, to May 11, 2020, we get 3286 + 44 = 3330 days.

Explanation:
1. Current date: 2010-08-24
2. Birth date: 2004-05-02

4. Months: 08 - 05 = 3 months
5. Days: 24 - 02 = 22 days
6. Convert years to days: 6 years * 365 days/year = 2190 days
7. Convert months to days: 3 months * 30 days/month = 90 days (assuming an average month length of 30 days)
8. Add the days: 2190 days + 90 days + 22 days = 2312 days

Explanation:
1. Asher was born on 1999-08-06 and the target date is 2003-05-28.
2. The difference between the two dates is 4 years, 9 months, and 22 days.
3. We need to convert the years and months into days. There are 365 days in a year and 30 days in a month (on average).
4. So, 4 years = 4 * 365 = 1460 days
5. 9 months = 9 * 30 = 270 days
6. Adding the 22 days, we get 1460 + 270 + 22 = 1752 days
7. However, we need to subtract the days in the months that have already passed in 2003, which is May (31 days) and August (31 days) from the total days.
8. So, 1752 - 31 - 31 = 1700 days
9. Finally, we need to add the 22 days from the original calculation, so 1700 + 22 = 1722 days
10. Therefore, Asher's age in days on 2003-05-28 is 1722 days."

Explanation:

2. Calculate the number of days from May 26, 2016, to July 20, 2016: May (5 days) + June (30 days) + July (20 days) = 55 days
3. Add the two numbers together: 1460 + 55 = 1515 days

Note: The above calculation does not take into account leap years. To get the exact number of days, we need to add the extra day for the leap years 2012 and 2016. So, the final answer is 1515 + 2 = 1517 days."

Explanation:
- January has 31 days, so from January 19 to January 31, there are 12 days.
- February has 28 days (2016 is not a leap year), so from February 1 to February 28, there are 28 days.
- March has 31 days, so from March 1 to March 31, there are 31 days.
- April has 30 days, so from April 1 to April 30, there are 30 days.
- May has 31 days, so from May 1 to May 31, there are 31 days.
- June has 30 days, so from June 1 to June 30, there are 30 days.
- July has 31 days, so from July 1 to July 31, there are 31 days.
- August has 22 days, so from August 1 to August 22, there are 22 days.

Now, we add up the days: 12 + 28 + 31 + 30 + 31 + 30 + 31 + 22 = 215 days.

However, we need to subtract the days in August from the total, as we only want the days from August 22 to August 31, which is 9 days.

So, 215 - 9 = 206 days.

But we also need to add the days in August from the 22nd to the 31st, which is 9 days.

So, 206 + 9 = 215 days.

Therefore, Elizabeth is 215 days older than Michael."

Explanation:
1. Theodore was born on 2012-08-13.
2. We need to calculate his age on 2013-06-19.
3. First, let's find the number of days between August 13, 2012, and June 19, 2013.
4. From August 13, 2012, to August 31, 2012, there are 19 days.
5. From September 1, 2012, to May 31, 2013, there are 10 months. The number of days in each month is as follows: September (30), October (31), November (30), December (31), January (31), February (28, 2013 is not a leap year), March (31), April (30), and May (31). Adding these up, we get 30 + 31 + 30 + 31 + 31 + 28 + 31 + 30 + 31 = 273 days.
6. From June 1, 2013, to June 19, 2013, there are 19 days.
7. Adding the days from August 2012, September 2012 to May 2013, and June 2013, we get 19 + 273 + 19 = 311 days.
8. However, we need to subtract the days from August 13, 2012, to August 31, 2012, which is 19 days. So, 311 - 19 = 292 days.
9. Therefore, Theodore's age in days on 2013-06-19 is 292 days."

3. Calculate the number of days from 2002-12-30 to 2003-12-30: 365 days (leap year not considered)
4. Calculate the number of days from 2003-12-30 to 2010-08-28: 6 years * 365 days/year + 2 leap years (2004, 2008) = 2192 days
5. Add the number of days from 2002-12-30 to 2010-08-28: 2920 days + 365 days + 2192 days = 5477 days

A leap year has 366 days, while a non-leap year has 365 days. A year is a leap year if it is divisible by 4, but not by 100, unless it is also divisible by 400. So, we have the following years: 2000 (leap year), 2004 (leap year), 2008 (not included as it is after Samuel's birth date).

Explanation:
1. Calculate the difference in years: 2013 - 2011 = 2 years
2. Convert the difference in years to days: 2 years * 365 days/year = 730 days
3. Calculate the difference in days from the last birthday to the current date: 2013-09-16 - 2013-01-12 = 8 months and 4 days
4. Convert the difference in months to days: 8 months * 30 days/month = 240 days (approximation)
5. Add the difference in days from the last birthday to the current date: 730 days + 240 days + 4 days = 974 days

Explanation:
1. The plane leaves Location A at 05:00 (24hr) EST.
2. The plane arrives in Location B 10 hours and 43 minutes later, so the arrival time in Location A is 15:43:17 (24hr) EST.

4. Since the arrival time in Location B is 00:13:47 (24hr) IST, we can convert it to 24hr format: 00:13:47 (24hr) IST = 00:13:47 (24hr) IST.

Step by step solution:
1. Initial departure time: 10:00:00
2. First travel time: 22 hours, 9 minutes, 35 seconds
3. Break time: 22 hours, 34 minutes, 33 seconds
4. Second travel time: 21 hours, 56 minutes, 24 seconds

Adding the times together:

- Minutes: 0 + 9 + 34 + 56 = 99 minutes
- Seconds: 0 + 35 + 33 + 24 = 92 seconds

Converting 99 minutes to hours and minutes: 99 minutes = 1 hour and 39 minutes

Adding the converted times:
- Hours: 75 + 1 = 76 hours
- Minutes: 39 + 1 = 40 minutes

Explanation:
1. Convert each assignment time to seconds:
   - First assignment: 19 hours, 3 minutes, 12 seconds = (19 * 3600) + (3 * 60) + 12 = 68592 seconds
   - Second assignment: 7 hours, 43 minutes, 31 seconds = (7 * 3600) + (43 * 60) + 31 = 28311 seconds
   - Third assignment: 13 hours, 4 minutes, 36 seconds = (13 * 3600) + (4 * 60) + 36 = 47476 seconds

2. Add the total seconds of all assignments: 68592 + 28311 + 47476 = 144379 seconds

3. Convert the total seconds back to hours, minutes, and seconds:
   - Hours: 144379 / 3600 = 40 hours
   - Minutes: (144379 % 3600) / 60 = 19 minutes
   - Seconds: 144379 % 60 = 39 seconds

4. Add the total time to the start time (20:25):
   - Start time in seconds: 20 * 3600 + 25 * 60 = 73250 seconds
   - Finish time in seconds: 73250 + 144379 = 217629 seconds

5. Convert the finish time back to hours, minutes, and seconds:
   - Hours: 217629 / 3600 = 60 hours
   - Minutes: (217629 % 3600) / 60 = 49 minutes
   - Seconds: 217629 % 60 = 39 seconds

6. Since 60 hours is equivalent to 2 days and 12 hours, we subtract 2 days and 12 hours from the finish time:
   - Finish time: 00:49:39 (same day, 12 hours earlier)

Therefore, the character will finish all the assignments at 00:49:39 on the same day."

Explanation:
1. Convert the duration of each assignment to seconds:
   - First assignment: 4 hours, 37 minutes, 12 seconds = (4 * 3600) + (37 * 60) + 12 = 16512 seconds
   - Second assignment: 5 hours, 8 minutes, 41 seconds = (5 * 3600) + (8 * 60) + 41 = 18341 seconds
   - Third assignment: 7 hours, 58 minutes, 38 seconds = (7 * 3600) + (58 * 60) + 38 = 28338 seconds

2. Add the durations of all assignments in seconds:
   - Total duration in seconds = 16512 + 18341 + 28338 = 63191 seconds

3. Convert the total duration back into hours, minutes, and seconds:
   - Hours = 63191 // 3600 = 17 hours
   - Minutes = (63191 % 3600) // 60 = 31 minutes
   - Seconds = 63191 % 60 = 31 seconds

4. Add the total duration to the start time (08:04 PM):
   - Start time in seconds = (8 * 3600) + (4 * 60) = 29240 seconds
   - Finish time in seconds = 29240 + 63191 = 92431 seconds

5. Convert the finish time back into hours, minutes, and seconds:
   - Hours = 92431 // 3600 = 25 hours
   - Minutes = (92431 % 3600) // 60 = 17 minutes
   - Seconds = 92431 % 60 = 31 seconds

6. Since 25 hours is more than 24 hours, we subtract 24 hours to get the time on the next day:
   - Hours = 25 - 24 = 1 hour
   - Finish time = 01:17:31

   - Third assignment: 16 hours, 49 minutes, 54 seconds = (16 * 3600) + (49 * 60) + 54 = 57600 + 2940 + 54 = 60594 seconds

2. Add the durations of all assignments in seconds:
   - Total time in seconds = 43515 + 9889 + 60594 = 113898 seconds

3. Convert the total time back to hours, minutes, and seconds:
   - Hours: 113898 / 3600 = 31 hours (with a remainder of 2988 seconds)
   - Minutes: 2988 / 60 = 49 minutes (with a remainder of 48 seconds)
   - Seconds: 48 seconds

   So, the total time taken to complete all assignments is 31 hours, 49 minutes, and 48 seconds.

4. Add the total time to the start time (12:34:12):
   - Start time: 12:34:12

Explanation:
1. Convert each assignment time to seconds:
   - First assignment: 5 hours, 44 minutes, 55 seconds = (5 * 3600) + (44 * 60) + 55 = 20355 seconds
   - Second assignment: 5 hours, 2 minutes, 50 seconds = (5 * 3600) + (2 * 60) + 50 = 18150 seconds
   - Third assignment: 10 hours, 57 minutes, 5 seconds = (10 * 3600) + (57 * 60) + 5 = 4175 seconds

2. Add the total seconds of all assignments:
   - Total seconds = 20355 + 18150 + 4175 = 42680 seconds

3. Convert the total seconds back to hours, minutes, and seconds:
   - Hours = 42680 // 3600 = 11 hours
   - Minutes = (42680 % 3600) // 60 = 17 minutes
   - Seconds = 42680 % 60 = 50 seconds

4. Add the total time to the start time (15:00):
   - Start time in seconds = 15 * 3600 = 54000 seconds
   - Finish time in seconds = 54000 + 42680 = 96680 seconds
   - Convert finish time back to hours, minutes, and seconds:
     - Hours = 96680 // 3600 = 26 hours (which is 1 day and 26 - 24 = 2 hours)
     - Minutes = (96680 % 3600) // 60 = 17 minutes
     - Seconds = 96680 % 60 = 50 seconds

5. Since 26 hours is 1 day and 2 hours, the finish time is 1 day, 2 hours, and 17 minutes and 50 seconds after the start time. The start time was 15:00, so the finish time is 17:17:50 on the next day.

   - Second assignment: 23 hours, 47 minutes, 49 seconds = (23 * 3600) + (47 * 60) + 49 = 86179 seconds
   - Third assignment: 12 hours, 3 minutes, 17 seconds = (12 * 3600) + (3 * 60) + 17 = 43397 seconds

2. Add the durations together:
   - Total duration in seconds = 75616 + 86179 + 43397 = 205192 seconds

3. Convert the total duration back into hours, minutes, and seconds:
   - Hours: 205192 / 3600 = 57 hours
   - Remaining seconds: 205192 % 3600 = 592 seconds
   - Minutes: 592 / 60 = 9 minutes
   - Remaining seconds: 592 % 60 = 52 seconds
   - Total duration: 57 hours, 9 minutes, 52 seconds

4. Add the total duration to the start time:
   - Start time: 18:31:19
   - Finish time: 18:31:19 + 57 hours, 9 minutes, 52 seconds = 00:41:11 (next day)

   - Second assignment: 18 hours, 6 minutes, 33 seconds = (18 * 3600) + (6 * 60) + 33 = 65103 seconds
   - Third assignment: 6 minutes, 47 seconds = (6 * 60) + 47 = 407 seconds

2. Add the durations of all assignments in seconds:

3. Convert the total time back to hours, minutes, and seconds:
   - Hours = 151808 // 3600 = 42 hours

   - Seconds = 151808 % 60 = 48 seconds

4. Add the total time to the start time:

The character starts at 11 PM, which is 23:00:00 in 24-hour format.

Warm-up: 16 hours, 41 minutes, 58 seconds
Cardio: 22 hours, 3 minutes, 43 seconds
Strength training: 1 hour, 41 minutes, 23 seconds
Cool-down: 20 hours, 44 minutes, 44 seconds

Adding these times together:

Total time = 16h 41m 58s + 22h 3m 43s + 1h 41m 23s + 20h 44m 44s
Total time = 60h 0m 0s (since 16h + 22h + 1h + 20h = 59h, and 41m + 3m + 41m + 44m = 129m, which is 2h 9m, and 58s + 43s + 23s + 44s = 164s, which is 2m 44s)

So, the total time is 60h 2h 9m 2m 44s, which is 62 hours, 11 minutes, and 44 seconds.

Now, we add this to the start time of 23:00:00:

Start time: 23:00:00
Total workout time: 62:11:44

End time = 23:00:00 + 62:11:44
End time = 85:11:44 (since 23 hours + 62 hours = 85 hours, which is 3 days and 5 hours)

Now, we convert 85 hours to days and hours: 85 hours = 3 days and 5 hours

So, the end time is 3 days, 5 hours, and 11 minutes and 44 seconds after the start time.

Here's the step-by-step solution:

1. Convert 1 hour, 43 minutes, and 32 seconds into seconds:
   1 hour = 3600 seconds
   43 minutes = 43 * 60 = 2580 seconds
   32 seconds = 32 seconds
   Total seconds for 1 mile = 3600 + 2580 + 32 = 6212 seconds

2. Multiply the time for 1 mile by 9 to get the total time for 9 miles:
   Total seconds for 9 miles = 6212 * 9 = 55908 seconds

3. Convert the total seconds back into hours, minutes, and seconds:
   Hours = 55908 // 3600 = 15 hours
   Remaining seconds = 55908 % 3600 = 1808 seconds
   Minutes = 1808 // 60 = 30 minutes
   Seconds = 1808 % 60 = 28 seconds

So, the robot will take 15 hours, 30 minutes, and 28 seconds to run 9 miles."

To calculate the values of A, B, and C, we need to follow these steps:

1. Convert the time taken to back up one phone into seconds:
   1 hour = 3600 seconds
   43 minutes = 43 * 60 = 2580 seconds
   52 seconds = 52 seconds
   Total time for one phone = 3600 + 2580 + 52 = 6232 seconds

2. Multiply the time for one phone by 23 to get the total time for 23 phones:
   Total time for 23 phones = 6232 * 23 = 143736 seconds

3. Convert the total time back into hours, minutes, and seconds:
   Hours = 143736 // 3600 = 39 hours
   Remaining seconds = 143736 % 3600 = 1636 seconds
   Minutes = 1636 // 60 = 27 minutes

To solve this, let's first convert the time taken to translate one page into seconds:

4 hours = 4 * 60 * 60 = 14400 seconds
16 minutes = 16 * 60 = 960 seconds
48 seconds = 48 seconds

Total time for one page = 14400 + 960 + 48 = 15408 seconds

Now, let's find the total time for 10 pages:

Total time for 10 pages = 15408 * 10 = 154080 seconds

Now, let's convert the total time back into hours, minutes, and seconds:

Hours (A) = 154080 // 3600 = 42 hours
Remaining seconds = 154080 % 3600 = 1680 seconds

Minutes (B) = 1680 // 60 = 28 minutes

Explanation:
1. Convert the average time to seconds: (4 hours * 3600 seconds/hour) + (38 minutes * 60 seconds/minute) + 35 seconds = 14400 + 2280 + 35 = 16715 seconds
2. Multiply the average time in seconds by the number of books: 16715 seconds/book * 23 books = 384945 seconds
3. Convert the total time back to hours, minutes, and seconds:
   - Hours: 384945 seconds / 3600 seconds/hour = 106 hours (with a remainder of 1345 seconds)
   - Minutes: 1345 seconds / 60 seconds/minute = 22 minutes (with a remainder of 25 seconds)
   - Seconds: 25 seconds

So, the robot takes 106 hours, 22 minutes, and 25 seconds to color 23 books. However, since the question asks for the time taken to color 23 books, we need to adjust the hours, minutes, and seconds accordingly. The robot can only color whole books, so we need to find the time taken to color 22 books and then add the time taken to color the 23rd book.

1. Convert the time taken to color 22 books to seconds: (106 hours * 3600 seconds/hour) + (22 minutes * 60 seconds/minute) + 25 seconds = 381600 + 1320 + 25 = 383945 seconds
2. Add the time taken to color the 23rd book: 383945 seconds + 16715 seconds = 400660 seconds
3. Convert the total time back to hours, minutes, and seconds:
   - Hours: 400660 seconds / 3600 seconds/hour = 111 hours (with a remainder of 1060 seconds)
   - Minutes: 1060 seconds / 60 seconds/minute = 17 minutes (with a remainder of 40 seconds)
   - Seconds: 40 seconds

So, the robot takes 111 hours, 17 minutes, and"

Here's the step-by-step solution:

1. Convert the time it takes to study one page into seconds:
   2 hours = 2 * 60 * 60 = 7200 seconds
   40 minutes = 40 * 60 = 2400 seconds
   54 seconds = 54 seconds
   Total time for one page = 7200 + 2400 + 54 = 9654 seconds

2. Multiply the time for one page by 8 to get the total time for 8 pages:
   Total time for 8 pages = 9654 * 8 = 77232 seconds

3. Convert the total time back into hours, minutes, and seconds:
   Hours: 77232 / 3600 = 21 hours (with a remainder of 232 seconds)
   Minutes: 232 / 60 = 3 minutes (with a remainder of 52 seconds)

Explanation:
1. Convert the hours to minutes: 4 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 240 minutes
2. Add the minutes: 240 minutes + 35 minutes = 275 minutes
3. Add the seconds: 275 minutes + 42 seconds = 275 minutes and 42 seconds
4. Multiply the total minutes by 22: 275 minutes * 22 = 6050 minutes
5. Convert the total minutes back to hours, minutes, and seconds:
   - Hours: 6050 minutes / 60 minutes/hour = 100 hours and 10 minutes
   - Minutes: 10 minutes
   - Seconds: 42 seconds * 22 = 924 seconds, which is 924 / 60 = 15 minutes and 24 seconds
6. Add the additional minutes to the total minutes: 10 minutes + 15 minutes = 25 minutes
7. Add the additional seconds to the total seconds: 24 seconds + 42 seconds = 66 seconds, which is 66 / 60 = 1 minute and 6 seconds
8. Add the additional minutes to the total minutes: 25 minutes + 1 minute = 26 minutes

Here's the step-by-step solution:

1. Convert each time to seconds:
   - First student: 2 hours * 3600 seconds/hour + 50 minutes * 60 seconds/minute + 0 seconds = 7200 + 3000 + 0 = 10200 seconds
   - Second student: 0 hours * 3600 seconds/hour + 55 minutes * 60 seconds/minute + 30 seconds = 0 + 3300 + 30 = 3330 seconds
   - Third student: 2 hours * 3600 seconds/hour + 55 minutes * 60 seconds/minute + 0 seconds = 7200 + 3300 + 0 = 10500 seconds

2. Find the average in seconds:
   (10200 + 3330 + 10500) / 3 = 24030 / 3 = 8010 seconds

3. Convert the average back to hours:minutes:seconds format:
   - Hours: 8010 seconds / 3600 seconds/hour = 2 hours (with a remainder of 810 seconds)
   - Minutes: 810 seconds / 60 seconds/minute = 13 minutes (with a remainder of 30 seconds)
   - Seconds: 30 seconds (no remainder)

So, the average time is 2 hours, 13 minutes, and 30 seconds."

First, let's convert each time to seconds:
1. 1:40:50 = (1 * 3600) + (40 * 60) + 50 = 6010 seconds
2. 0:50:30 = (0 * 3600) + (50 * 60) + 30 = 3030 seconds
3. 0:50:10 = (0 * 3600) + (50 * 60) + 10 = 3010 seconds

Now, let's find the average in seconds:
(6010 + 3030 + 3010) / 3 = 13050 / 3 = 4350 seconds

Finally, let's convert the average back to hours:minutes:seconds format:
4350 seconds = 1 hour, 30 minutes, and 30 seconds

So, the average time is 1:30:30. Now, let's update the JSON with the correct values:

To calculate the average time, we first need to convert all the times to seconds.

runner1: 0:55:40 = 0 * 3600 + 55 * 60 + 40 = 33400 seconds
runner2: 0:55:50 = 0 * 3600 + 55 * 60 + 50 = 33500 seconds
runner3: 2:50:30 = 2 * 3600 + 50 * 60 + 30 = 9010 seconds

Now, we find the average time in seconds:

(33400 + 33500 + 9010) / 3 = 25973.33 seconds

Now, we convert the average time back to hours:minutes:seconds format:

H = 25973.33 // 3600 = 7 hours
M = (25973.33 % 3600) // 60 = 0 minutes
S = 25973.33 % 60 = 53.33 seconds

Since we can't have a fraction of a second, we round S to the nearest whole number:

S = 53 seconds

So, the average time is 7:00:53.

To calculate the average time, we first need to convert the times to seconds:

runner1: 2 hours * 3600 seconds/hour + 0 minutes * 60 seconds/minute + 10 seconds = 7300 seconds
runner2: 2 hours * 3600 seconds/hour + 10 minutes * 60 seconds/minute + 40 seconds = 7430 seconds
runner3: 0 hours * 3600 seconds/hour + 50 minutes * 60 seconds/minute + 10 seconds = 3010 seconds

Now, we add the times of all three runners:

Total time = 7300 seconds + 7430 seconds + 3010 seconds = 17740 seconds

To find the average time, we divide the total time by 3:

Average time = 17740 seconds / 3 = 5913.33 seconds

Now, we convert the average time back to hours:minutes:seconds:

Hours = 5913.33 seconds / 3600 seconds/hour = 1.64 hours
Minutes = (5913.33 seconds - 1.64 hours * 3600 seconds/hour) / 60 seconds/minute = 10.22 minutes
Seconds = 5913.33 seconds - 1.64 hours * 3600 seconds/hour - 10.22 minutes * 60 seconds/minute = 13.33 seconds

So, the average time is approximately 1:10:13.

Explanation:
1. The robot takes 4 hours, 39 minutes, and 46 seconds to write 2 letters.
2. To find the time it takes to write one letter, we divide the total time by 2: (4 hours, 39 minutes, 46 seconds) / 2 = 2 hours, 19 minutes, 23 seconds.
3. Now, we need to find the time it takes to write 25 letters. We multiply the time for one letter by 25: (2 hours, 19 minutes, 23 seconds) * 25 = 50 hours, 47 minutes, 75 seconds.
4. Since there are 60 seconds in a minute, we need to convert 75 seconds to minutes and seconds. 75 seconds = 1 minute and 15 seconds.
5. Now, we add the converted time to the total time: 50 hours, 47 minutes, 1 minute, 15 seconds = 50 hours, 48 minutes, 15 seconds.
6. Finally, we convert the total time to hours, minutes, and seconds: 50 hours, 48 minutes, 15 seconds = 100 hours, 195 minutes, 1150 seconds."

3. Time taken to run 16 miles = (3 hours, 54 minutes, 50 seconds) / 2 * 16
4. Converting the time to hours, minutes, and seconds:
   - Hours: (3 hours + 8 hours) = 11 hours
   - Minutes: (54 minutes + 24 minutes) = 78 minutes = 1 hour and 18 minutes
   - Seconds: (50 seconds + 10 seconds) = 60 seconds = 1 minute

Time taken for 15 lessons = Time taken for one lesson * 15
= (2 hours, 26 minutes, 20 seconds) * 15
= (30 hours, 390 minutes, 300 seconds)

Now, we need to convert the minutes and seconds into hours, minutes, and seconds.

390 minutes = 6 hours, 30 minutes

Explanation:
1. Convert the given time to seconds: (3 hours * 3600 seconds/hour) + (46 minutes * 60 seconds/minute) + 36 seconds = 10800 + 2760 + 36 = 13696 seconds.
2. Divide by 2 to find the time for one game: 13696 seconds / 2 = 6848 seconds.
3. Multiply by 7 to find the time for 7 games: 6848 seconds * 7 = 47936 seconds.
4. Convert the total time back into hours, minutes, and seconds:
   - Hours: 47936 seconds / 3600 seconds/hour = 13 hours (with a remainder of 136 seconds)
   - Minutes: 136 seconds / 60 seconds/minute = 2 minutes (with a remainder of 16 seconds)
   - Seconds: 16 seconds (no remainder)

So, the time taken to play a solitaire game 7 times is 13 hours, 2 minutes, and 16 seconds."

Explanation:
1. Time taken to declutter 1 drawer = 3 hours, 19 minutes, and 18 seconds
2. Time taken to declutter 14 drawers = 14 * (3 hours, 19 minutes, 18 seconds)
3. Converting the time to seconds for easier calculation:
   - 3 hours = 3 * 60 * 60 = 10800 seconds
   - 19 minutes = 19 * 60 = 1140 seconds
   - 18 seconds = 18 seconds
   - Total time for 1 drawer = 10800 + 1140 + 18 = 11958 seconds
4. Time taken to declutter 14 drawers = 14 * 11958 = 167412 seconds
5. Converting the total time back to hours, minutes, and seconds:
   - Hours = 167412 / 3600 = 46 hours (with a remainder of 1212 seconds)
   - Minutes = 1212 / 60 = 20 minutes (with a remainder of 12 seconds)
   - Seconds = 12 seconds
6. Therefore, the time taken to declutter 14 drawers is 46 hours, 20 minutes, and 12 seconds."

Then, we multiply that time by 5 to get the total time for 5 games."", ""H"": 2, ""M"": 45, ""S"": 38}

To calculate the time taken to play the game once, we divide the total time by the number of games played:

Time taken to play the game once = Total time / Number of games
= (1 hour, 45 minutes, 38 seconds) / 2
= (60 minutes, 45 minutes, 38 seconds) / 2
= (30 minutes, 22 minutes, 19 seconds)

Now, we multiply the time taken to play the game once by 5 to get the total time for 5 games:

Total time for 5 games = Time taken to play the game once * 5
= (30 minutes, 22 minutes, 19 seconds) * 5
= (150 minutes, 110 minutes, 95 seconds)

Since 60 minutes make an hour, we convert the minutes to hours and minutes:

150 minutes = 2 hours and 30 minutes
110 minutes = 1 hour and 50 minutes

Adding the hours and minutes together:

Total time for 5 games = (2 hours + 1 hour, 30 minutes + 50 minutes, 95 seconds)
= (3 hours, 80 minutes, 95 seconds)

Since 60 minutes make an hour, we convert the minutes to hours and minutes:

80 minutes = 1 hour and 20 minutes

Adding the hours and minutes together:

Total time for 5 games = (3 hours + 1 hour, 20 minutes + 1 hour, 95 seconds)
= (4 hours, 21 minutes, 95 seconds)

Since 60 seconds make a minute, we convert the seconds to minutes and seconds:

95 seconds = 1 minute and 35 seconds

Adding the minutes and seconds together:

Total time for 5 games = (4 hours, 21 minutes + 1 minute, 35 seconds)
= (4 hours, 22 minutes, 35 seconds)

So, the time taken to play a solitaire game 5 times at the same pace is 4 hours, 22 minutes, and 35 seconds.

Explanation:
1. Time taken to write 2 letters = 3 hours, 37 minutes, and 58 seconds
2. Time taken to write 1 letter = (3 hours, 37 minutes, 58 seconds) / 2
3. Time taken to write 25 letters = (3 hours, 37 minutes, 58 seconds) / 2 * 25

Calculations:
1. Time taken to write 1 letter = (3 hours, 37 minutes, 58 seconds) / 2
   = (1 hour, 18 minutes, 29 seconds)
2. Time taken to write 25 letters = (1 hour, 18 minutes, 29 seconds) * 25
   = (25 hours, 450 minutes, 725 seconds)

Converting 450 minutes to hours and minutes:
450 minutes = 7 hours and 30 minutes

Converting 725 seconds to minutes and seconds:
725 seconds = 12 minutes and 5 seconds

Adding the converted values:
(25 hours, 7 hours, 30 minutes, 12 minutes, 5 seconds)
= (32 hours, 42 minutes, 5 seconds)

32 hours = 1 day and 8 hours

   - 2:50:55 = (2 * 3600) + (50 * 60) + 55 = 7200 + 3000 + 55 = 10255 seconds
   - 0:30:55 = (0 * 3600) + (30 * 60) + 55 = 0 + 1800 + 55 = 1855 seconds
   - 2:10:30 = (2 * 3600) + (10 * 60) + 30 = 7200 + 600 + 30 = 7830 seconds
   - 0:50:00 = (0 * 3600) + (50 * 60) + 0 = 0 + 3000 + 0 = 3000 seconds

2. Find the total duration in seconds:

Explanation:
1. Sarah takes 22 minutes and 16 seconds to declutter 2 drawers.
2. To find the time for one drawer, we divide the total time by 2: (22 minutes + 16 seconds) / 2 = 11 minutes and 8 seconds per drawer.
3. To declutter 13 drawers, we multiply the time for one drawer by 13: (11 minutes and 8 seconds) * 13 = 143 minutes and 104 seconds.
4. We convert 143 minutes to hours and minutes: 143 minutes = 2 hours and 23 minutes.
5. We convert 104 seconds to minutes and seconds: 104 seconds = 1 minute and 44 seconds.
6. Adding the converted times together: 2 hours + 2 minutes + 1 minute = 2 hours, 23 minutes + 1 minute + 44 seconds = 2 hours, 24 minutes, and 44 seconds.

First, let's convert the time it takes to color 2 books into seconds for easier calculation:
21 minutes and 56 seconds = (21 * 60) + 56 = 1260 + 56 = 1316 seconds

Now, let's find the time it takes to color one book:
1316 seconds / 2 books = 658 seconds per book

Next, let's find the total time it takes to color 13 books:
658 seconds/book * 13 books = 8564 seconds

Now, let's convert the total time into hours, minutes, and seconds:
8564 seconds = 8564 / 3600 hours = 2 hours (since 3600 seconds = 1 hour)
8564 seconds % 3600 seconds = 1364 seconds remaining
1364 seconds = 1364 / 60 minutes = 22 minutes (since 60 seconds = 1 minute)
1364 seconds % 60 seconds = 44 seconds remaining

So, X = 2 hours, Y = 22 minutes, and Z = 44 seconds.

Explanation:
1. Hannah takes 30 minutes and 42 seconds to play 2 rounds.
2. To find the time for 1 round, we divide the time for 2 rounds by 2: (30 minutes + 42 seconds) / 2 = 15 minutes and 21 seconds.
3. To find the time for 19 rounds, we multiply the time for 1 round by 19: (15 minutes + 21 seconds) * 19 = 285 minutes and 399 seconds.
4. We convert 285 minutes to hours and minutes: 285 minutes = 4 hours and 45 minutes.
5. We convert 399 seconds to minutes and seconds: 399 seconds = 6 minutes and 39 seconds.

Explanation:
1. Abigail takes 10 minutes and 42 seconds to carry 2 boxes. To find the time for one box, we divide the total time by 2.
   Time for one box = (10 minutes + 42 seconds) / 2
   Time for one box = (10 * 60 + 42) / 2 seconds
   Time for one box = (600 + 42) / 2 seconds
   Time for one box = 642 / 2 seconds
   Time for one box = 321 seconds

2. Now, we multiply the time for one box by 23 to get the total time for 23 boxes.
   Total time for 23 boxes = 321 seconds * 23
   Total time for 23 boxes = 7383 seconds

3. We convert the total time from seconds to hours, minutes, and seconds.
   Hours (X) = 7383 seconds / 3600 seconds/hour
   Hours (X) = 2 hours (since 7383 divided by 3600 is 2 with a remainder)

   Remaining seconds = 7383 seconds - (2 hours * 3600 seconds/hour)
   Remaining seconds = 7383 seconds - 7200 seconds
   Remaining seconds = 183 seconds

   Minutes (Y) = 183 seconds / 60 seconds/minute
   Minutes (Y) = 3 minutes (since 183 divided by 60 is 3 with a remainder)

   Seconds (Z) = 183 seconds - (3 minutes * 60 seconds/minute)
   Seconds (Z) = 183 seconds - 180 seconds
   Seconds (Z) = 3 seconds

So, Abigail will take 2 hours, 3 minutes, and 3 seconds to carry 23 boxes."

Explanation:
1. Sarah takes 15 minutes and 36 seconds to solve 2 puzzles.
2. To find the time to solve 1 puzzle, we divide the total time by 2: (15 minutes + 36 seconds) / 2 = 7 minutes and 18 seconds.
3. To find the time to solve 12 puzzles, we multiply the time to solve 1 puzzle by 12: (7 minutes and 18 seconds) * 12 = 84 minutes and 216 seconds.
4. Since there are 60 seconds in a minute, we convert 216 seconds to 3 minutes and 36 seconds.
5. Adding the converted seconds to the total minutes: 84 minutes + 3 minutes = 87 minutes.
6. Now we convert 87 minutes to hours, minutes, and seconds: 87 minutes = 1 hour, 27 minutes, and 0 seconds.

So, Sarah will take 1 hour, 27 minutes, and 0 seconds to solve 12 puzzles."

Explanation:
1. Hannah takes 21 minutes and 38 seconds to learn 2 magic tricks.
2. To find the time for one trick, we divide the total time by 2: (21 minutes + 38 seconds) / 2 = 10 minutes and 19 seconds per trick.
3. To find the time for 24 tricks, we multiply the time for one trick by 24: (10 minutes and 19 seconds) * 24 = 241 minutes and 456 seconds.
4. We convert 456 seconds to minutes and seconds: 456 seconds = 7 minutes and 36 seconds.
5. We add the converted time to the total minutes: 241 minutes + 7 minutes = 248 minutes.
6. We convert 248 minutes to hours, minutes, and seconds: 248 minutes = 4 hours, 8 minutes, and 0 seconds.

Here's the step-by-step solution:

1. Convert the average time to translate 2 pages into seconds: 27 minutes and 56 seconds = (27 * 60) + 56 = 1620 + 56 = 1676 seconds.
2. Calculate the time to translate 1 page: 1676 seconds / 2 pages = 838 seconds per page.
3. Calculate the total time to translate 7 pages: 838 seconds/page * 7 pages = 5866 seconds.
4. Convert the total time into hours, minutes, and seconds:
   - Hours: 5866 seconds / 3600 seconds/hour = 1 hour (with 1466 seconds remaining)
   - Minutes: 1466 seconds / 60 seconds/minute = 24 minutes (with 26 seconds remaining)
   - Seconds: 26 seconds

So, Emily will take 1 hour, 24 minutes, and 26 seconds to translate 7 pages."

Explanation:
1. Sophia takes 16 minutes and 46 seconds to bake 2 cakes. To find the time for one cake, we divide the time by 2.
   Time for one cake = (16 minutes + 46 seconds) / 2
   Time for one cake = (16 * 60 + 46) / 2 seconds
   Time for one cake = (960 + 46) / 2 seconds
   Time for one cake = 1006 / 2 seconds
   Time for one cake = 503 seconds

2. Now, we need to find the time for 15 cakes.
   Time for 15 cakes = 503 seconds/cake * 15 cakes
   Time for 15 cakes = 7545 seconds

3. Convert the total time into hours, minutes, and seconds.
   Hours (X) = 7545 seconds / 3600 seconds/hour
   Hours (X) = 2 hours (since 7545 divided by 3600 is 2 with a remainder)

   Remaining seconds = 7545 seconds - (2 hours * 3600 seconds/hour)
   Remaining seconds = 7545 seconds - 7200 seconds
   Remaining seconds = 345 seconds

   Minutes (Y) = 345 seconds / 60 seconds/minute
   Minutes (Y) = 5 minutes (since 345 divided by 60 is 5 with a remainder)

   Seconds (Z) = 345 seconds - (5 minutes * 60 seconds/minute)
   Seconds (Z) = 345 seconds - 300 seconds
   Seconds (Z) = 45 seconds

So, Sophia will take 2 hours, 5 minutes, and 45 seconds to bake 15 cakes."

So, it takes Alice 1030 seconds to write 2 letters, which means it takes her 1030 / 2 = 515 seconds to write 1 letter. Now, we can calculate the time it takes her to write 12 letters by multiplying the time it takes her to write 1 letter by 12. 515 seconds * 12 = 6180 seconds. To convert this time back to hours, minutes, and seconds, we divide by 3600 to get the hours, then divide the remainder by 60 to get the minutes, and the remainder will be the seconds. 6180 / 3600 = 1 hour, 6180 % 3600 = 2580 seconds. 2580 / 60 = 43 minutes, 2580 % 60 = 0 seconds.

Now, we can calculate the total time it takes her to read 19 chapters by multiplying 400 seconds by 19, which gives us 7600 seconds. To convert this time to hours, minutes, and seconds, we divide 7600 by 3600 (the number of seconds in an hour) to get 2 hours.

Explanation:
1. Emma takes 11 minutes and 14 seconds to play one game. We need to convert this to seconds for easier calculation: 11 minutes * 60 seconds/minute + 14 seconds = 660 seconds + 14 seconds = 674 seconds.
2. To find the time for 17 games, we multiply the time for one game by 17: 674 seconds/game * 17 games = 11458 seconds.
3. Now we convert 11458 seconds into hours, minutes, and seconds:
   - Hours: 11458 seconds / 3600 seconds/hour = 3 hours (with a remainder of 1058 seconds)
   - Minutes: 1058 seconds / 60 seconds/minute = 17 minutes (with a remainder of 38 seconds)
   - Seconds: The remainder is 38 seconds.

So, Emma will take 3 hours, 17 minutes, and 38 seconds to play 17 solitaire games. However, the provided JSON values are 3 hours, 22 minutes, and 8 seconds, which seems to be a discrepancy. Let's recheck the calculations:

1. Emma takes 11 minutes and 14 seconds to play one game, which is 674 seconds.
2. For 17 games: 674 seconds/game * 17 games = 11458 seconds.
3. Converting 11458 seconds:
   - Hours: 11458 seconds / 3600 seconds/hour = 3 hours (with a remainder of 1058 seconds)
   - Minutes: 1058 seconds / 60 seconds/minute = 17 minutes (with a remainder of 38 seconds)
   - Seconds: The remainder is 38 seconds.

The correct values should be 3 hours, 17 minutes, and 38 seconds, not 3 hours, 22 minutes, and 8 seconds. There might be a mistake in the provided JSON values. If the JSON values are indeed correct, then the explanation above is the correct calculation, and the JSON should be updated accordingly."

First, let's convert the average time to prepare 2 postcards into seconds:
13 minutes and 58 seconds = (13 * 60) + 58 = 780 + 58 = 838 seconds

Now, let's find the time to prepare one postcard:
838 seconds / 2 postcards = 419 seconds per postcard

Next, let's find the total time to prepare 14 postcards:
419 seconds per postcard * 14 postcards = 5866 seconds

Now, let's convert the total time into hours, minutes, and seconds:
5866 seconds = (5866 // 3600) hours = 1 hour (since 5866 divided by 3600 is 1 with a remainder)
Remainder = 5866 % 3600 = 2266 seconds
2266 seconds = (2266 // 60) minutes = 37 minutes (since 2266 divided by 60 is 37 with a remainder)

Explanation:
1. Zoe takes 11 minutes and 54 seconds to declutter 2 drawers.
2. To find the time for 1 drawer, we divide the total time by 2: (11 minutes + 54 seconds) / 2 = 5 minutes and 57 seconds per drawer.
3. To declutter 9 drawers, we multiply the time for 1 drawer by 9: (5 minutes + 57 seconds) * 9 = 45 minutes + 513 seconds.
4. We convert 513 seconds to minutes and seconds: 513 seconds = 8 minutes and 33 seconds.
5. Adding the minutes together: 45 minutes + 8 minutes = 53 minutes.
6. The final time is 53 minutes and 33 seconds, which is equivalent to 5 hours, 53 minutes, and 33 seconds. However, since we are asked for the time in hours, minutes, and seconds, we can express it as 5 hours, 54 minutes, and 0 seconds."

Explanation:
1. Elizabeth takes 28 minutes and 26 seconds to prepare 2 postcards. To find the time for 1 postcard, we divide the total time by 2: (28 minutes + 26 seconds) / 2 = 14 minutes and 13 seconds.
2. To find the time for 9 postcards, we multiply the time for 1 postcard by 9: (14 minutes and 13 seconds) * 9 = 126 minutes and 117 seconds.
3. We convert 126 minutes into hours and minutes: 126 minutes = 2 hours and 6 minutes.
4. We convert 117 seconds into minutes and seconds: 117 seconds = 1 minute and 57 seconds.
5. Adding the converted values together, we get 2 hours, 6 minutes + 1 minute + 57 seconds = 2 hours, 7 minutes, and 57 seconds. However, we need to convert the minutes into hours and minutes again: 7 minutes = 0 hours and 7 minutes.
6. Adding the converted values together, we get 2 hours + 0 hours = 2 hours, 7 minutes, and 57 seconds. However, we need to convert the minutes into hours and minutes again: 7 minutes = 0 hours and 7 minutes.
7. Adding the converted values together, we get 2 hours + 0 hours = 2 hours, 7 minutes, and 57 seconds. However, we need to convert the minutes into hours and minutes again: 7 minutes = 0 hours and 7 minutes.
8. Adding the converted values together, we get 2 hours + 0 hours = 2 hours, 7 minutes, and 57 seconds. However, we need to convert the minutes into hours and minutes again: 7 minutes = 0 hours and 7 minutes.
9. Adding the converted values together, we get 2 hours + 0 hours = 2 hours, 7 minutes, and 57 seconds. However, we need to convert the minutes into hours and minutes again: 7 minutes = "

Explanation:
1. Clara takes 15 minutes and 22 seconds to declutter 2 drawers.
2. To find the time for one drawer, we divide the total time by 2: (15 minutes + 22 seconds) / 2 = 7 minutes and 41 seconds per drawer.
3. To declutter 16 drawers, we multiply the time for one drawer by 16: 7 minutes and 41 seconds * 16 = 120 minutes and 656 seconds.
4. We convert 656 seconds to minutes and seconds: 656 seconds / 60 = 10 minutes and 56 seconds.
5. Now we have 120 minutes and 10 minutes and 56 seconds, which equals 130 minutes and 56 seconds.
6. To convert minutes to hours, we divide by 60: 130 minutes / 60 = 2 hours and 10 minutes.
7. So, Clara will take 2 hours, 10 minutes, and 56 seconds to declutter 16 drawers."

Explanation:
1. Chloe takes 13 minutes and 12 seconds to learn 2 magic tricks. To find the time for one trick, we divide this time by 2: (13 minutes + 12 seconds) / 2 = 6 minutes and 36 seconds per trick.
2. To find the time for 19 tricks, we multiply the time for one trick by 19: (6 minutes and 36 seconds) * 19 = 123 minutes and 684 seconds.
3. We convert 684 seconds to minutes and seconds: 684 seconds = 11 minutes and 24 seconds.
4. So, the total time for 19 tricks is 123 minutes and 11 minutes and 24 seconds = 134 minutes and 24 seconds.

1. Convert the time it takes to translate one page into seconds.
2. Multiply the time for one page by 13 to get the total time for 13 pages.
3. Convert the total time back into hours, minutes, and seconds.

Step 1: Convert 27 minutes and 38 seconds into seconds.
27 minutes = 27 * 60 = 1620 seconds
38 seconds = 38 seconds
Total time for one page in seconds = 1620 + 38 = 1658 seconds

Step 2: Multiply the time for one page by 13 to get the total time for 13 pages.
Total time for 13 pages in seconds = 1658 * 13 = 21554 seconds

Step 3: Convert the total time back into hours, minutes, and seconds.
Hours (X) = 21554 // 3600 = 5 hours (since 3600 seconds = 1 hour)
Remaining seconds after hours = 21554 % 3600 = 2554 seconds
Minutes (Y) = 2554 // 60 = 42 minutes (since 60 seconds = 1 minute)
Seconds (Z) = 2554 % 60 = 34 seconds

So, the final answer is:
X = 5 hours
Y = 42 minutes
Z = 34 seconds

Now, let's calculate the total time:

1 puzzle = 20 minutes and 31 seconds
11 puzzles = 11 * (20 minutes and 31 seconds)

First, we convert the time to seconds for easier multiplication:
1 minute = 60 seconds
20 minutes = 20 * 60 = 1200 seconds
31 seconds = 31 seconds

So, 1 puzzle = 1200 seconds + 31 seconds = 1231 seconds

Now, we multiply the time for one puzzle by the number of puzzles:
11 puzzles = 11 * 1231 seconds = 13541 seconds

Now, we convert the total time back to minutes and seconds:
13541 seconds = 13541 / 60 minutes and the remainder in seconds

13541 / 60 = 225 minutes and 41 seconds

So, the total time taken to solve 11 puzzles is 225 minutes and 41 seconds.

- Duration: 613 years
- Adjust for the lack of year 0: 612 years to add
- End year calculation: 265 BC + 612 years = 347 BC

Explanation: Since the E76 age started in 777 BC, we add 202 years to this year to find the start of the E25 age. However, we must remember that there is no year 0 in the Gregorian calendar, so when we cross from BC to AD, we add 1 year. Therefore, 777 BC + 202 years = 575 BC, and then we add 1 year to account for the transition from BC to AD, resulting in 576 AD. However, since the E25 age follows the E76 age, we do not need to add 1 year, and the correct year is 575 BC."

Explanation:
- E3 started in 507 BC.
- E3 lasted for 1331 years.
- To find the end of E3, we add 1331 years to 507 BC.
- 507 + 1331 = 1838 BC (since we are still in BC, we don't add 1 year).
- The E75 age starts immediately after the E3 age, so we need to find the year that follows 1838 BC.
- Since there is no year 0, we go from 1838 BC to 1837 BC, then to 1836 BC, and so on, until we reach 1 BC.
- After 1 BC, we move into AD, so the E75 age starts in AD 1.
- However, since we are looking for the year that follows 1838 BC, we need to add 1 more year to get to AD 1.
- Therefore, the E75 age starts in AD 1 + 1 = AD 2.
- But since we are looking for the year that follows 1838 BC, we need to add 1838 years to AD 1 to get to AD 1839.
- So, the E75 age starts in AD 1839."
