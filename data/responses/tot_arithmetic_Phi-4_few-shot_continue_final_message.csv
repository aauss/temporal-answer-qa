Adding these up, we get 10 + 28 + 31 + 30 + 31 + 30 + 26 = 186 days. Now we need to find out how many 19-day cycles have passed in these 186 days. We do this by dividing 186 by 19, which gives us 9 with a remainder of 15. This means that 9 full cycles have passed, and they are 15 days into the 10th cycle. Since they go to the restaurant every 19 days, the next time they will go is 19 - 15 = 4 days from 26-07-2014.

First, we calculate the number of full years in 1063 days. A common year has 365 days, and a leap year has 366 days. From 2023 to 2027, the leap years are 2024.

We need to find the date 1971 days from 2016-Dec-30. We can break this down into years, months, and days. \n\n1. Calculate the number of years in 1971 days: \n   - 1971 days / 365.25 days per year (accounting for leap years) ≈ 5.39 years. \n   - This means 5 full years and some extra days. \n\n2. Calculate the number of days in 5 years from 2016: \n   - 2016 is a leap year, so it has 366 days. \n   - 2017, 2018, 2019, 2020 (leap year), and 2021 are the next 5 years. \n   - Total days = 366 + 365 + 365 + 365 + 366 + 365 = 2192 days. \n\n3. Since 2192 days is more than 1971 days, we need to adjust: \n   - Subtract the days of 2021: 2192 - 365 = 1827 days. \n   - 1971 - 1827 = 144 days remaining after 2020. \n\n4. Add 144 days to 2020-12-30: \n   - January has 31 days, so 144 - 31 = 113 days remaining. \n   - February 2021 has 28 days (not a leap year), so 113 - 28 = 85 days remaining. \n   - March has 31 days, so 85 - 31 = 54 days remaining. \n   - April has 30 days, so 54 - 30 = 24 days remaining. \n   - May has 31 days, so 24 days into May is 2021-05-24. \n\nTherefore, the date 1971 days from 2016-12-30 is 2021-05-24."", ""answer"": ""2021-05-24""}"

We need to find the date 1173 days from 1997-Dec-30. We can break this down into years, months, and days. \n\n1. Calculate the number of full years in 1173 days. A common year has 365 days, and a leap year has 366 days. From 1997 to 2001, the leap years are 2000. \n   - 1998: 365 days\n   - 1999: 365 days\n   - 2000: 366 days (leap year)\n   - 2001: 365 days\n   Total for these 4 years = 1461 days\n   Since 1173 < 1461, we don't complete 4 years.\n\n2. Calculate the number of full years within 1173 days:\n   - 1998: 365 days\n   - 1999: 365 days\n   - 2000: 366 days\n   Total for 3 years = 1096 days\n   Remaining days = 1173 - 1096 = 77 days\n\n3. Add 77 days to 2001-01-01:\n   - January has 31 days, so 77 - 31 = 46 days remaining\n   - February 2001 has 28 days (not a leap year), so 46 - 28 = 18 days remaining\n   - Add 18 days to March 1, 2001, which gives us March 18, 2001.\n\nTherefore, the date 1173 days from 1997-Dec-30 is 2001-03-18."", ""answer"": ""2001-03-18""}"

The total time to complete all assignments is 1733 + 23422 + 39538 = 64693 seconds. Now we need to convert the start time to seconds. 10:15:36 is 10 * 3600 + 15 * 60 + 36 = 36936 seconds. The finish time in seconds is 36936 + 64693 = 101629 seconds. Now we need to convert the finish time back to the required format. 101629 // 3600 = 28 hours. The remainder is 101629 - (28 * 3600) = 101629 - 100800 = 829 seconds. 829 // 60 = 13 minutes. The remainder is 829 - (13 * 60) = 829 - 780 = 49 seconds. 28 hours is 1 day and 4 hours.
