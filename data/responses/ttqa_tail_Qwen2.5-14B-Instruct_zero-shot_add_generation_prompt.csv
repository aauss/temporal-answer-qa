Step 2: Identify the orbital period.
The orbital period is given as 164.8 years.

Step 3: Add the orbital period to the time of perihelion.
Since the orbital period is 164.8 years, we add this duration to the time of perihelion. The next orbital period will begin on 2042-Sep-04 + 164.8 years.

Step 4: Calculate the exact date.
Adding 164.8 years to 2042 results in 2206.8 years. Since we cannot have a fraction of a year in a calendar date, we round up to the next whole year, which is 2207.

Final Answer: The next orbital period will begin around the year 2207."

","To determine at what age an Australian can both serve and be deployed in the Australian Defence Force, we need to look at the ""Military age"" information provided in the Personnel section of the table.

The ""Military age"" row provides different ages for various stages:
- 16.5 years (for selection)
- 17 years (to serve)
- 18 years (to deploy)
- 19 years (for special forces deployment)

From this information, we see that:
- An individual can start serving at 17 years old.
- An individual can begin deploying at 18 years old.

Since the question asks for the age when one can both serve and be deployed, the relevant age here is the higher of these two, which is 18 years old.

Final Answer: 18 years old"

","To determine at what age Dhanraj Pillay competed in his first Asian Games, we need to follow these steps:

1. Identify Dhanraj Pillay's birth year from the personal information.
2. Find the earliest mentioned Asian Games participation year.
3. Calculate the age based on the difference between the participation year and birth year.

Step 1: From the ""Personal information"" section:
- Full name: Dhanraj Pillay
- Born: 16 July 1968

Step 2: From the ""Asian Games"" section:
- The earliest mentioned Asian Games is the Silver medal in 1990 Beijing.

Step 3: Calculating the age:
- Birth year: 1968
- First Asian Games: 1990
- Age in 1990 = 1990 - 1968 = 22 years old

Since he was born on July 16th, he would have turned 22 in 1990 if the games were after that date. Given that the Asian Games in Beijing took place in 1990, it is safe to assume he was 22 during that event.

Final Answer: Dhanraj Pillay was 22 years old when he competed in his first Asian Games."

","First, let's identify the key information we need from the table to answer this question:

1. We're looking for Eddy Merckx's last win of 34 individual stages at the Tour de France.
2. The table provides a list of his achievements in the Tour de France under the ""Grand Tours"" section.

Now, let's examine the relevant information:

- Under the Tour de France section, it lists individual stage wins as: ""(1969-1972, 1974, 1975)""
- This means that he won stages in those years, but it doesn't specify how many he won each year.
- The question specifies 34 individual stages, but the table doesn't break down the number of stage wins per year.
- However, based on the years provided, the latest year mentioned is 1975.

Since the exact year when he won the 34th stage isn't specified, we can only determine the latest year he was winning stages at the Tour de France based on the information given.

Finally, we need to calculate Eddy Merckx's age in 1975:
- Born on 17 June 1945
- In 1975, he would have been 30 years old (as of December 1975).

Final Answer: Eddy Merckx was 30 years old when he last won individual stages at the Tour de France according to the information provided, though the exact count of 34 stages isn't specified yearly."

","To determine Eddy Merckx's age when he won gold at the 1964 World Championships, we need to follow these steps:

1. Identify Eddy Merckx's birth year from the personal information section.
2. Calculate his age in 1964.

Step 1: From the ""Personal information"" section, we see that Eddy Merckx was born on 17 June 1945.

Step 2: To calculate his age in 1964:
- The difference between 1964 and 1945 is 19 years.
- Since the exact date of the event (Sallanches World Championships) isn't specified but it took place in 1964, we can assume it happened sometime during that year. Given Merckx's birthday is in June, he would have turned 19 in June 1964, making him 19 years old for most of the year.

Therefore, Eddy Merckx was 19 years old when he won gold at the 1964 World Championships.

Final Answer: Eddy Merckx was 19 years old when he won gold at the 1964 World Championships."

The earliest start year is 1971 (Combined Islands and Leeward Islands), and the latest end year is 1993 (Glamorgan).

Therefore, Viv Richards' total domestic playing career spans from 1971 to 1993.

Now, let's calculate the duration:
1993 - 1971 = 22 years

Final Answer: Viv Richards played domestically for 22 years."

","To find out how many days after launch the ExoMars performed its orbital insertion, we need to calculate the difference between the launch date and the orbital insertion date.

1. Launch date: 14 March 2016
2. Orbital insertion date: 19 October 2016

Now let's break it down month by month:
- From March 14 to March 31: 17 days
- April has 30 days
- May has 31 days
- June has 30 days
- July has 31 days
- August has 31 days
- September has 30 days
- From October 1 to October 19: 19 days

Adding these up:
17 + 30 + 31 + 30 + 31 + 31 + 30 + 19 = 229 days

Therefore, the ExoMars performed its orbital insertion 229 days after launch.

","To find out how many days after the 2022 celebration ended the 2023 celebration began, we need to follow these steps:

1. Identify the dates for the 2022 and 2023 celebrations.
2. Calculate the number of days between the end of the 2022 celebration and the start of the 2023 celebration.

Step 1: Identifying the dates:
- The 2022 celebration ended at nightfall on March 17, 2022.
- The 2023 celebration started at sunset on March 6, 2023.

Step 2: Calculating the number of days:
- From March 18, 2022 (the day after the 2022 celebration ended) to March 6, 2023 (the start of the 2023 celebration), we have:
  - Full years: 1 year = 365 days
  - Days from March 18, 2022 to March 6, 2023:
    - In 2022: 18 days left in March
    - In 2023: 6 days in March
    - Total days excluding full years: 18 + 6 = 24 days

So, the total number of days is 365 (full year) + 24 (remaining days) = 389 days.

['Logo of the Islamic Republican Party.png', 'Politics of Iran | Political parties | Elections']

","To find out how many days have passed since the dissolution of the Islamic Republican Party, we need to follow these steps:

1. Identify the dissolution date of the party.
2. Calculate the number of days from that date until December 2022.

Step 1: Identifying the dissolution date:
The table states that the Islamic Republican Party was dissolved on 1 June 1987.

Step 2: Calculating the number of days from June 1, 1987, to December 2022:
Since the exact day in December 2022 isn't specified, we'll consider it as December 31, 2022, for the maximum possible number of days.
- From June 1, 1987, to December 31, 2022, spans across 35 years and 6 months.
- In those 35 years, there are 9 leap years (1988, 1992, 1996, 2000, 2004, 2008, 2012, 2016, 2020).
- So, the total number of days would be: 
  (35 * 365) + 9 (leap days) + days from June 1 to December 31 in 1987 + days from January 1 to December 31 in 2022.

Let's break down the months:
- June has 30 days; so from June 1 to June 30 = 29 days.
- July = 31 days
- August = 31 days
- September = 30 days
- October = 31 days
- November = 30 days
- December = 31 days
So, the days from June 1 to December 31 in 1987 = 29 + 31 + 31 + 30 + 31 + 30 + 31 = 213 days.

And for the full years:
- 2022 is not a leap year, so it has 365 days.

Adding all these up:
(35 * 365) + 9 + 213 + 365 = 12775"

- From July 14, 1943, to June 6, 1944, is more than one year.
- To calculate the exact number of days, we need to count from July 14, 1943, to June 6, 1944.
- Days remaining in July 1943: 17 days (from the 14th to the end of July)
- Full months from August 1943 to May 1944: 31 (Aug) + 30 (Sep) + 31 (Oct) + 30 (Nov) + 31 (Dec) + 28 (Jan, since it's not a leap year) + 28 (Feb) + 31 (Mar) + 30 (Apr) + 31 (May) = 301 days
- Days from June 1 to June 6, 1944: 6 days

Total days: 17 + 301 + 6 = 324 days

Therefore, the I-179 was sunk 324 days before D-Day.

","To determine how many days separate the Western and Eastern Good Friday dates in the same year, we need to compare the dates provided for both traditions:

- For 2021:
  - Western: April 2
  - Eastern: April 30

- For 2023:
  - Western: April 7
  - Eastern: April 14
- For 2024:
  - Western: March 29
  - Eastern: May 3

We will calculate the difference between these dates for each year:

1. 2021: 
   - April 30 - April 2 = 28 days (since April has 30 days, subtracting 2 from 30 gives 28)

2. 2022:
   - April 22 - April 15 = 7 days

3. 2023:
   - April 14 - April 7 = 7 days

4. 2024:
   - May 3 - March 29
     - First, count the remaining days in March after the 29th: 31 - 29 = 2 days
     - Then add the full month of April: 30 days
     - Finally, add the days in May before the 3rd: 3 days
     - Total: 2 + 30 + 3 = 35 days

From the calculations above, the differences in days between Western and Eastern Good Friday dates range from 7 to 28 days, with the largest gap being 35 days in 2024.

Final Answer: The maximum number of days separating the Western and Eastern Good Friday dates in the same year is 35 days."

","To determine how many months after being laid down HMS Argyll was commissioned, we need to calculate the time difference between these two events.

1. Identify the date when HMS Argyll was laid down:
   - Laid down: 20 March 1987

2. Identify the date when HMS Argyll was commissioned:
   - Commissioned: 31 May 1991

3. Calculate the time difference between these dates:
   - From March 1987 to February 1991 is 4 years.
   - Adding March 1991 brings us to 4 years and 1 month.
   - HMS Argyll was commissioned on 31 May 1991, which adds 2 more months to the count.

Therefore, the total time from being laid down to being commissioned is 4 years and 3 months.

4. Convert this period into months:
   - 4 years = 4 * 12 months = 48 months
   - 48 months + 3 months = 51 months

","To find out how many months after being launched HMS Astute was commissioned, we need to calculate the time difference between its launch date and commissioning date.

1. Launch date: 8 June 2007
2. Commissioning date: 27 August 2010

Let's break this down month by month:

- From June 2007 to July 2007 = 1 month
- August 2007 to July 2008 = 12 months
- August 2008 to July 2009 = 12 months
- August 2009 to July 2010 = 12 months
- August 2010 (up to commissioning date, 27th) = part of 1 month

Adding these together:
1 + 12 + 12 + 12 + 1 = 38 months

However, since we only count full months before the commissioning date, we subtract the partial month in August 2010:

38 - 1 = 37 months

Final Answer: HMS Astute was commissioned 37 months after it was launched."

","To find out how many months after being ordered HMS Victory was laid down, we need to calculate the time difference between these two dates:

1. Ordered date: 14 July 1758
2. Laid down date: 23 July 1759

First, let's determine the difference in years:
- The year 1759 is one year after 1758.

Next, let's determine the difference in months:
- Both dates are in July, but the ship was ordered on the 14th and laid down on the 23rd. This means that the ship was laid down exactly 12 months and 9 days after it was ordered.

Since the question asks for the number of months, we can say that HMS Victory was laid down approximately 12 months after being ordered.

","To find out how many months after launch the Mars orbiter insertion occurred for ExoMars, we need to calculate the time difference between the launch date and the orbital insertion date.

1. **Identify the Launch Date:** The launch date provided is 14 March 2016.
2. **Identify the Orbital Insertion Date:** The orbital insertion date provided is 19 October 2016.
3. **Calculate the Time Difference:**
   - From March 14th to March 31st: 17 days (March has 31 days)
   - April: 30 days
   - May: 31 days
   - June: 30 days
   - July: 31 days
   - August: 31 days
   - September: 30 days
   - October 1st to October 19th: 19 days

Adding these up:
\[ 17 + 30 + 31 + 30 + 31 + 31 + 30 + 19 = 249 \text{ days} \]

4. **Convert Days into Months:**
   - There are approximately 30.44 days in a month (considering the average length of a month).
   - Therefore, \( \frac{249}{30.44} \approx 8.18 \text{ months} \).

Rounding to the nearest whole number gives us 8 months.

**Final Answer:** The Mars orbiter insertion for ExoMars occurred about 8 months after the launch."

['A photograph of a small, old book with Hebrew text and an illustration on the right-hand page. | 18th-century manuscript of the prayer of Al HaNissim on the miracles of Purim']

","To determine how many months after the 2022 celebration the 2024 celebration is, let's follow these steps:

1. Identify the dates for both years:
   - 2022: Sunset, 16 March - nightfall, 17 March
   - 2024: Sunset, 23 March - nightfall, 24 March

2. Calculate the time difference between these two dates:
   - Both celebrations fall in March.
   - In 2022, it starts on March 16.
   - In 2024, it starts on March 23.

3. Determine the number of days between these two start dates:
   - From March 16 to March 23 is 7 days.

4. Convert this time difference into months:
   - Since there are approximately 30.44 days in a month (considering an average year),
   - 7 days is approximately 7 / 30.44 ≈ 0.23 months.

However, since we're looking for the difference in terms of full months and considering the calendar structure, it's more practical to note that the difference falls within the same month.

Therefore, the 2024 celebration starts less than one month after the 2022 celebration.

Final Answer: Less than one month."

","To find out how many months after the order was the Tonnerre laid down, we need to calculate the difference between the dates when it was ordered and laid down.

The order date for Tonnerre is given as 16 April 1794.
The date when it was laid down is given as 22 September 1794.

Step 1: Calculate the number of days between these two dates.
- From 16 April to 30 April: 14 days
- May has 31 days
- June has 30 days
- July has 31 days
- August has 31 days
- From 1 September to 22 September: 22 days

Total number of days = 14 + 31 + 30 + 31 + 31 + 22 = 169 days

Step 2: Convert the number of days into months.
Since there's no fixed number of days in a month, we can approximate the number of months by dividing the total number of days by the average number of days in a month (approximately 30.44 days/month).

Number of months ≈ 169 / 30.44 ≈ 5.55 months

Final Answer: The Tonnerre was laid down approximately 5.55 months after it was ordered."

","To determine how many months ago Hurricane Ivan existed, we need to follow these steps:

1. Identify when Hurricane Ivan occurred.
2. Calculate the time difference between its occurrence and the current date.

Step 1: Identifying when Hurricane Ivan occurred
From the table, we see that Hurricane Ivan formed on September 2, 2004, and dissipated on September 25, 2004.

Step 2: Calculating the time difference
- Current date: December, 2022
- End date of Hurricane Ivan: September 25, 2004

Now let's calculate the number of months:
- From September 25, 2004, to September 25, 2022, is exactly 18 years.
- Adding the remaining months from September 25, 2022, to December 2022:
  - October (1 month)
  - November (2 months)
  - December (3 months)

So, the total number of months from September 25, 2004, to December 2022 is:
18 years * 12 months/year + 3 months = 216 + 3 = 219 months

Since the question asks for the number of months ago, we should consider the entire period during which Hurricane Ivan existed (from September 2 to September 25, 2004), which is approximately 18 years and 3 months.

Final Answer: Hurricane Ivan existed approximately 219 months ago."

","To determine how many months ago the Israel Defense Forces were founded, we need to follow these steps:

1. Identify the founding date of the Israel Defense Forces from the given information.
2. Calculate the time difference between the founding date and the current date (December 2022).
3. Convert this time difference into months.

Step 1: The founding date of the Israel Defense Forces is given as 26 May 1948.

Step 2: We need to calculate the number of months from May 26, 1948, to December 2022. 
- From May 26, 1948, to December 2022 is 74 years and 6 months and 26 days (as of December 2022).
- Since we're asked for months, we'll convert the years into months first:
  - 74 years = 74 * 12 = 888 months
  - Adding the additional 6 months gives us 888 + 6 = 894 months
  - Days are not relevant for a precise month count in this context.

Step 3: The result from Step 2 gives us the total number of months since the founding of the IDF.

Final Answer: The Israel Defense Forces were founded 894 months ago."

","First, let's identify the relevant information from the table:
- The ship was launched on 31 July 1992.
- It was commissioned on 2 June 1994.

However, there seems to be a discrepancy in the question. The table does not mention any launch date in 2005. Instead, it states that HMS Montrose was launched in 1992 and commissioned in 1994.

To calculate the number of months between the launch and commissioning, we need to count the months from July 1992 to June 1994:

1. From July 1992 to June 1993: 12 months
2. From July 1993 to June 1994: another 12 months

Therefore, the total time taken from launch to commissioning is 24 months.

Since the question asks about a launch in 2005, which doesn't align with the data provided, I'll provide the answer based on the correct dates given in the table.

Final Answer: It took 24 months for HMS Montrose to be commissioned after its launch in 1992."

","To determine how many months the I-179 lasted after being completed, we need to follow these steps:

1. Identify the completion date of the ship.
2. Identify the date when the ship was sunk.
3. Calculate the difference between these two dates in months.

Step 1: The completion date of the ship is given as 18 June 1943.

Step 2: The sinking event is described as ""Sunk during sea trials, 14 July 1943"". So, the ship sank on 14 July 1943.

Step 3: Now, calculate the time between 18 June 1943 and 14 July 1943:
- From 18 June to 30 June = 12 days
- From 1 July to 14 July = 14 days
Total days = 12 + 14 = 26 days

Since the question asks for the duration in months, we convert 26 days into months. Considering a month is approximately 30 days:
26 days ≈ 26 / 30 ≈ 0.87 months

Therefore, the ship lasted approximately 0.87 months after being completed.

Final Answer: The I-179 lasted about 0.87 months after being completed."

","To determine how many months elapsed between the laying down and the launching of the Maori, we need to identify the dates for these two events from the table and calculate the difference in time.

From the table:
- The ship was laid down on 6 July 1936.
- The ship was launched on 2 September 1937.

Let's break this down month by month:
1. From July 1936 to June 1937 is exactly one year, which equals 12 months.
2. Then, from July 1937 to September 1937 is an additional 2 months.

So, the total number of months between laying down and launching is 12 + 2 = 14 months.

2. Calculate the time difference between the arrival date and the current date (December 2022).

Step 2: Now, let's calculate the duration from 25 January 2020 to December 2022:
- From January 2020 to December 2022 is 3 years.
- Each year has 12 months, so 3 years would be 3 * 12 = 36 months.
- Since we're counting from the 25th of January, we have to include the month of January 2020 but exclude the full month of December 2022, which means we should subtract one month from our total.
- Therefore, the total duration is 36 - 1 = 35 months.

","First, let's identify the relevant information from the table:

- Laid down: 1 November 1989
- Launched: 31 July 1992

The question asks about the time difference in 2005, but based on the information provided in the table, the ship was laid down and launched in different years (1989 and 1992 respectively). Therefore, we should calculate the difference between these two dates instead.

To calculate the months between these two dates:
1. Calculate the number of months from November 1989 to December 1989: 1 month.
2. Add the full years between January 1990 and June 1992: 36 months (3 years).
3. Calculate the number of months from July 1992 to July 1992: 0 months.

Adding these together gives us 1 + 36 + 0 = 37 months.

However, since the ship was launched on July 31, 1992, and it was laid down on November 1, 1989, we need to subtract the partial months:
- From November 1989 to July 1992 is 33 months (subtracting the extra 4 months counted above).

","To determine how many months were between Waqar Younis's last Test and his last ODI, we need to follow these steps:

1. Identify the dates of Waqar Younis's last Test and last ODI.
2. Calculate the difference in time between these two dates.
3. Convert this difference into months.

Step 1: Identifying the dates
- Last Test: 2 January 2003
- Last ODI: 4 March 2003

Step 2: Calculating the difference in time
- From 2 January 2003 to 4 March 2003, there are:
  - 31 days remaining in January after the 2nd
  - All 28 days of February (assuming it's not a leap year)
  - 4 days in March up to the 4th

This totals to 31 + 28 + 4 = 63 days.

Step 3: Converting the difference into months
- To convert days into months, we can approximate that 1 month equals about 30 days.
- Therefore, 63 days is approximately 63 / 30 ≈ 2.1 months.

Final Answer: There were approximately 2 months between Waqar Younis's last Test and his last ODI."

","To determine how many months were left in the ExoMars mission as of December 2022, we need to follow these steps:

1. Identify the planned mission duration.
2. Calculate the elapsed time since the start of the mission.
3. Subtract the elapsed time from the total planned duration to find the remaining time.

Step 1: The planned mission duration is 7 years.

Step 2: The elapsed time is given as 6 years, 3 months, and 18 days.

Step 3: We now subtract the elapsed time from the total planned duration:
- Planned mission duration: 7 years
- Elapsed time: 6 years, 3 months, and 18 days

We can break down the calculation into years and months:
- Remaining years: 7 - 6 = 1 year
- Since we have 3 months already elapsed within the last year, we convert the remaining year into months: 1 year * 12 months/year = 12 months
- Remaining months: 12 months - 3 months = 9 months

Therefore, there are 9 months left in the ExoMars mission as planned.

","To find out how many more days were there between the Western and Eastern Easter dates in 2024 compared to 2022, let's follow these steps:

1. Identify the dates for Western and Eastern Easter in 2022:
   - Western Easter: April 17
   - Eastern Easter: April 24

2. Calculate the difference between the two dates in 2022:
   - Difference = April 24 - April 17 = 7 days

3. Identify the dates for Western and Eastern Easter in 2024:
   - Western Easter: March 31
   - Eastern Easter: May 5

4. Calculate the difference between the two dates in 2024:
   - From March 31 to April 1: 1 day
   - From April 1 to May 5: 31 + 5 = 36 days total, but since we've already counted the first day of April, we subtract 1 day
   - Therefore, the difference = 36 - 1 = 35 days

5. Compare the differences:
   - 2022 difference: 7 days
   - 2024 difference: 35 days

6. Calculate the additional number of days in 2024 compared to 2022:
   - Additional days = 35 - 7 = 28 days

Final Answer: There were 28 more days between the Western and Eastern Easter dates in 2024 compared to 2022."

","To find out how many more months the ExoMars mission is planned to last, we need to follow these steps:

1. Identify the planned mission duration from the given information.
2. Calculate how much time has already passed since the start of the mission.
3. Subtract the elapsed time from the planned mission duration to determine the remaining time.

Step 1: The planned mission duration is stated as 7 years.

Step 2: The elapsed time is provided as 6 years, 3 months, and 18 days.

Step 3: To calculate the remaining time:
- Planned duration: 7 years = 7 * 12 = 84 months

","From the information provided in the table, we can determine the time each person served as a leader:

1. Winston Churchill was in office from 1951 to 1955.
   - Duration: 1955 - 1951 = 4 years

2. Harold Macmillan was in office from 1957 to 1960.
   - Duration: 1960 - 1957 = 3 years

Now, let's calculate how many more years Winston Churchill served compared to Harold Macmillan:
- Difference: 4 years - 3 years = 1 year

Therefore, Winston Churchill served for one more year as a leader than Harold Macmillan.

","To determine how many more years Waqar Younis played for Surrey compared to Glamorgan, we need to identify the duration he played for each team from the provided domestic team information.

For Surrey:
The entry shows ""1990-1993"", which means he played for Surrey from 1990 to 1993, inclusive. To calculate the number of years, subtract the start year from the end year and add one because both the start and end years count as full seasons.
Number of years for Surrey = 1993 - 1990 + 1 = 4 years

For Glamorgan:
The entry shows ""1997-1998"", which means he played for Glamorgan from 1997 to 1998, inclusive.
Number of years for Glamorgan = 1998 - 1997 + 1 = 2 years

Now, subtract the number of years played for Glamorgan from the number of years played for Surrey to find out how many more years he played for Surrey.
Difference = Number of years for Surrey - Number of years for Glamorgan = 4 - 2 = 2 years

Final Answer: Younis played 2 more years for Surrey than for Glamorgan."

","The table provides information about the IBSF World Championships for the two-man event held in 2017. It also mentions that there was a previous championship in 2016 and a subsequent one in 2019. 

To determine how many more years until the next IBSF World Championships after the provided data, we need to identify the most recent year mentioned and consider if a pattern can be discerned.

1. The most recent year given in the table for the championships is 2019.
2. Since no other years are provided and we're looking for the next championship, we have to assume that the championships occur regularly but the exact frequency isn't explicitly stated beyond these three instances.
3. However, since the question asks about the next championships and based on the provided timeline of 2016, 2017, and 2019, it seems plausible to infer that the championships might not follow a strict yearly schedule but rather occur every two years.

Given that the last mentioned championship was in 2019 and the current date is December 2022, and assuming the pattern of every two years continues:
- The next championship would logically be expected in 2023 if it follows a biennial schedule starting from 2019.

However, since the question specifically asks for ""how many more years until the next,"" and considering we are already past the presumed next occurrence (2023) based on the pattern, we should look ahead to the next logical year after 2023, which would be 2025 if following a consistent two-year interval.

Final Answer: 2 years until the next IBSF World Championships, assuming a biennial schedule starting from 2019. Given the current date is December 2022, the next championship would be in 2025."

","To determine how many more years Valverde was with the Puente Tocinos team compared to the Illes Balears–Banesto team, we'll follow these steps:

1. Identify the duration Valverde spent on each team.
2. Subtract the number of years he was with Illes Balears–Banesto from the number of years with Puente Tocinos.

Step 1:
Puente Tocinos: From 1989 to 1998
Duration = 1998 - 1989 + 1 = 10 years (adding 1 because both start and end years are inclusive)

Illes Balears–Banesto: From 2005 to 2010
Duration = 2010 - 2005 + 1 = 6 years

Step 2:
Difference in years = Duration with Puente Tocinos - Duration with Illes Balears–Banesto
= 10 - 6 = 4 years

Therefore, Valverde was with Puente Tocinos for 4 more years than with Illes Balears–Banesto.

","To determine how many total years Kimi Räikkönen competed, we need to look at his active years in both Formula One and World Rally Championship.

For Formula One:
- Active years: 2001-2009, 2012-2021
  - From 2001 to 2009: 2009 - 2001 + 1 = 9 years
  - From 2012 to 2021: 2021 - 2012 + 1 = 10 years
  - Total Formula One years: 9 + 10 = 19 years

For World Rally Championship:
- Active years: 2009-2011
  - From 2009 to 2011: 2011 - 2009 + 1 = 3 years

Now, let's add the years from both championships:
- Total years competing: 19 (Formula One) + 3 (World Rally Championship) = 22 years

However, there is some overlap between Formula One and World Rally Championship during the years 2009-2011. We should not count these years twice.
- Overlap years: 2009-2011 = 3 years

Subtracting the overlap from the total:
- Adjusted total years competing: 22 - 3 = 19 years

Therefore, the total number of years Kimi Räikkönen competed is 19 years.

","To determine how many total years Yamamoto played in his senior career, we need to look at the start year of his first senior team appearance and the end year of his last senior team appearance.

From the ""Senior career*"" section:
- His first senior club was Kyoto Purple Sanga in 2001.
- His last senior club was Ococias Kyoto AC until 2018.

So, he started playing for senior teams in 2001 and finished in 2018.

Now, let's calculate the number of years:
2018 - 2001 = 17 years

However, since he began playing in 2001 but didn't complete a full year that season, we should subtract one year from our calculation:

17 - 1 = 16 years

","To determine the total number of years Michael Schumacher was active in his career, we need to identify the start and end dates of his active years from the given information.

From the table:
- His first entry into Formula One was in 1991 (Belgian Grand Prix).
- His last entry was in 2012 (Brazilian Grand Prix).

His active years are listed as two periods:
1. 1991-2006
2. 2010-2012

However, since he started in 1991 and stopped in 2006 before coming back in 2010, we should calculate the total duration across these two periods.

For the period 1991-2006:
- Start year: 1991
- End year: 2006
- Duration: 2006 - 1991 + 1 = 16 years (adding 1 because both start and end years count)

For the period 2010-2012:
- Start year: 2010
- End year: 2012
- Duration: 2012 - 2010 + 1 = 3 years

Adding these durations together gives us the total active years:
- Total active years: 16 years + 3 years = 19 years

Final Answer: Michael Schumacher was active for a total of 19 years in his career."

","First, let's identify the relevant information from the table:

1. The timeline for the Anti-Libyan Chadian factions:
   - FAT (1978-1979)
   - FAN (1978-1983)
   - FANT (1983-1987)
   - GUNT (1986-1987)

From this information, we can see that:
- FAT operated from 1978 to 1979.
- GUNT became an Anti-Libyan Chadian faction starting from 1986.

Now, let's calculate the number of years between these two periods:

- From 1979 (end of FAT's period) to 1986 (start of GUNT's period) = 7 years

Therefore, the answer is 7 years.

Final Answer: 7 years"

","To find out how many years passed between when HMS Argyll was ordered and when it was launched, we need to follow these steps:

1. Identify the order date: According to the table, HMS Argyll was ordered in September 1986.
2. Identify the launch date: The table states that HMS Argyll was launched on 8 April 1989.
3. Calculate the time difference:
   - From September 1986 to September 1987 is one year.
   - From October 1987 to September 1988 is another year.
   - From October 1988 to September 1989 is yet another year.
   - Then from September 1989 to April 1989, it's less than a year, but we only count full years here.

So, adding up these periods gives us a total of 2 full years plus some additional months. Since we're asked for the number of years and typically such questions look for full years unless specified otherwise, we'll consider only complete years.

Therefore, HMS Argyll was launched 2 years and some extra months after it was ordered, but in terms of full years, it would be 3 years if we include the partial third year.

","Firstly, there seems to be an inconsistency in the information provided in the question compared to the data given in the table. According to the table, HMS Montrose was ordered in July 1988, not in 2005 as mentioned in the question. 

Following the data from the table:
1. HMS Montrose was ordered in July 1988.
2. It was launched on 31 July 1992.

To calculate the number of years between these two dates:
3. From July 1988 to July 1992 is exactly 4 years.

Therefore, based on the data provided in the table, the correct answer should be that HMS Montrose was launched 4 years after it was ordered. However, since the question specifically asks about the difference if it was ordered in 2005, we will calculate that as well, although it contradicts the table data:

If HMS Montrose was ordered in 2005 and launched in 1992, which would imply a negative timeline (since it would mean launching before ordering), this scenario doesn't logically fit real-world conditions. Hence, we stick to the data given in the table for a realistic answer.

Final Answer: Based on the data in the table, HMS Montrose was launched 4 years after it was ordered. The scenario where it was ordered in 2005 does not align with the timeline given in the table and would result in an illogical time sequence."

","First, we need to identify when the photo was taken. The image caption mentions that it was taken at the launch of PSL in 2015.

Next, we find out when Waqar Younis last played for Allied Bank Limited. From the domestic team information, it's clear that he played for Allied Bank Limited in 2003/04.

Now, we calculate the difference between these two dates:
2015 - 2003 = 12 years

Therefore, the picture was taken 12 years after Younis played for Allied Bank Limited.

* Up to date as of July 2011.

","To determine how many years passed between Kaiō Hiroyuki achieving his highest rank and his retirement, we need to follow these steps:

1. Identify when Kaiō Hiroyuki achieved his highest rank.
   - The table states that his highest rank was Ōzeki in September 2000.

2. Identify when Kaiō Hiroyuki retired.
   - The table indicates that he retired in July 2011.

3. Calculate the difference between these two dates.
   - From September 2000 to July 2011:
     * From September 2000 to September 2010 is 10 years.
     * Adding the months from September 2010 to July 2011 gives us 10 months.
   - Therefore, the total time span is 10 years and 10 months.

Since the question asks for the number of years, we can say it's approximately 11 years, but more precisely, it's 10 years and 10 months.

","The information provided states that the party was originally founded as Birlik on 26 April 2013, and it changed its name to Adal on 5 November 2020.

To find how many years passed from the founding as Birlik to changing the name to Adal, we need to calculate the difference between these two dates.

From 26 April 2013 to 5 November 2020:
- From 26 April 2013 to 26 April 2020 is exactly 7 years.
- Then, from 26 April 2020 to 5 November 2020 is 6 months and 10 days.

Since the question asks for the number of years, we can approximate this additional period as approximately half a year (0.5 years).

Therefore, the total time elapsed is approximately 7 years + 0.5 years = 7.5 years.

","To find out how many years after being laid down did HMS Somerset launch, we need to look at the dates provided for both events.

1. The ship was laid down on 12 October 1992.
2. The ship was launched on 25 June 1994.

Now, let's calculate the difference between these two dates:

- From 12 October 1992 to 12 October 1993 is one year.
- From 12 October 1993 to 12 October 1994 is another year.
- Since the launch happened on 25 June 1994, which is before 12 October 1994, we need to add the fraction of the third year from 12 October 1993 to 25 June 1994. However, since we're looking for the full years that have passed, we only count complete years.

Therefore, the total number of years between the laying down and launching of HMS Somerset is 1 year and part of the second year, but since we are counting full years, it's 1 + 1 = 2 years.

","To find out how many years after being laid down the HMS Astute was launched, we need to look at the dates provided for these two events.

From the table:

Now, let's calculate the difference between these two dates.

1. From January 31, 2001, to January 31, 2007, is exactly 6 years.
2. Then from January 31, 2007, to June 8, 2007, is an additional period within the same year.

Since we're calculating the time in years, we can consider this additional period as less than a full year but more than zero years. Thus, it adds only a fraction of a year to our total, which we generally round to whole years unless specified otherwise.

Therefore, the HMS Astute was launched approximately 6 years after it was laid down.

","To determine how many years after being laid down the HMS Victory was launched, we need to identify the dates for both events and calculate the difference between them.

From the provided information:
- The HMS Victory was laid down on 23 July 1759.
- The HMS Victory was launched on 7 May 1765.

Now let's calculate the time difference:
1. From 23 July 1759 to 23 July 1765 is exactly 6 years.
2. Since the launch date (7 May 1765) is earlier than 23 July 1765 within the same year, we need to subtract one year from our initial calculation.

Therefore, the HMS Victory was launched 6 - 1 = 5 years after it was laid down.

","To determine how many years after being laid down the I-179 was completed, we need to look at the dates for when the ship was laid down and when it was completed.

From the table:
- Laid down: 21 August 1941
- Completed: 18 June 1943

Now, let's calculate the time difference between these two dates.

1. From 21 August 1941 to 18 June 1943 spans over parts of two calendar years, 1941 and 1943.
2. First, calculate the remaining days from 21 August 1941 until the end of 1941:
   - Days from 21 August to 31 December 1941 = (31 - 21 + 1) + 30 + 31 = 11 + 30 + 31 = 72 days
3. The entire year of 1942 is included.
4. Then, calculate the days from the start of 1943 until 18 June 1943:
   - Days from 1 January to 18 June 1943 = 31 (Jan) + 28 (Feb) + 31 (Mar) + 30 (Apr) + 31 (May) + 18 (Jun) = 169 days

Adding these periods together:
- 72 days (remaining part of 1941) + 365 days (full year of 1942) + 169 days (part of 1943) = 606 days

Convert days into years:
- 606 days / 365 days/year ≈ 1.66 years

However, since we typically measure such durations in whole years for simplicity in historical contexts, we can say that the ship took about 2 years from being laid down to being completed.

Final Answer: The I-179 was completed approximately 2 years after it was laid down."

Step 1: Identify the year of launch and completion.
- Launch: 1937
- Completion: 1938

Step 2: Calculate the time span.
Since the ship was launched in September 1937 and completed in November 1938, it took less than a full year. However, the question asks for the number of years, so we consider the full calendar years involved.

From September 1937 to September 1938 is exactly one year. Since the completion happened later in the same year (November), the ship was indeed completed within one year of its launch.

Therefore, the HMS Maori was completed 1 year after it was launched.

","To find out how many years after being ordered HMS Victory was launched, we need to:

1. Identify the date when HMS Victory was ordered.
2. Identify the date when HMS Victory was launched.
3. Calculate the difference between these two dates.

Step 1: The date HMS Victory was ordered is given as 14 July 1758.

Step 2: The date HMS Victory was launched is given as 7 May 1765.

Step 3: To calculate the difference:
- From 14 July 1758 to 7 May 1765, we can break this down into full years plus additional days.
- From 14 July 1758 to 14 July 1765 is exactly 7 years.
- We then need to account for the additional period from 14 July 1765 to 7 May 1765. This is less than a year, so it does not add a full year to our count but completes the launch year.

Therefore, the total time from ordering to launching is 7 years minus the days from mid-July to early May, which doesn't affect the whole number of years.

Final Answer: HMS Victory was launched 7 years after being ordered."

","To determine how many years after being ordered the HMS Astute was laid down, we need to follow these steps:

1. Identify the date when the ship was ordered.
2. Identify the date when the ship was laid down.
3. Calculate the difference between these two dates.

From the table:
- The ship was ordered in March 1997.
- The ship was laid down on 31 January 2001.

Now, let's calculate the difference:

1. From March 1997 to March 2001 is exactly 4 years.
2. Since the ship was laid down on 31 January 2001, which is before March 2001, we need to subtract one month from our calculation.

Therefore, the ship was laid down approximately 3 years and 10 months after it was ordered.

However, the question asks for the number of years, so we can round this to 4 years since the majority of the time has passed.

","To find out how many years after debuting Haguroyama Masaji retired, we need to follow these steps:

1. Identify the debut year from the table.
2. Identify the retirement year from the table.
3. Subtract the debut year from the retirement year.

Step 1: From the table, we can see that Haguroyama Masaji's debut was in January, 1934.

Step 2: According to the table, Haguroyama Masaji retired in September, 1953.

Step 3: To calculate the number of years between his debut and retirement:
- Retirement year: 1953
- Debut year: 1934
- Years between debut and retirement: 1953 - 1934 = 19 years

However, since he debuted in January 1934 and retired in September 1953, we need to consider if the full year of 1953 counts as a complete year of activity. Since he retired in September, it means he only competed for part of 1953. Therefore, we should subtract one year from our calculation.

Final Answer: Haguroyama Masaji retired 18 years after debuting."

","To determine how many years after turning professional Mohamed El Shorbagy became ranked number one in the world, we need to follow these steps:

1. Identify when Mohamed El Shorbagy turned professional.
2. Identify when he was ranked World No. 1.
3. Calculate the difference between these two dates.

Step 1: Turning Professional
From the table, it is mentioned that Mohamed El Shorbagy ""Turned Pro"" in 2006.

Step 2: Becoming World No. 1
The table states that his ""Highest ranking"" was ""World No. 1 (November 2014)"".

Step 3: Calculating the Difference
To calculate the number of years from 2006 to November 2014:
- From 2006 to 2014 is 8 years.
- Since the exact month isn't specified for when he turned pro within 2006, we can assume it happened before November, which means the full 8 years include the period until November 2014.

Therefore, the number of years after turning professional that Mohamed El Shorbagy became ranked number one in the world is 8 years.

Step 3: Now we calculate the difference:
- From January 1997 to December 1997 is nearly a full year.
- From January 1998 to December 2006 covers 9 full years.
- Adding the partial year from January 2007 to September 2007 is approximately 9 months, which rounds up to a full year for simplicity in this context.

Adding these periods together: 1 + 9 + 1 = 11 years.

* Up to date as of June 2020.

","To determine how many years passed between Futabayama Sadaji's debut and retirement, we need to follow these steps:

1. Identify the debut year from the table.
2. Identify the retirement year from the table.
3. Subtract the debut year from the retirement year.

Step 1: From the table, Futabayama Sadaji's debut was in March 1927.

Step 2: The table indicates that he retired in November 1945.

Step 3: To calculate the number of years between these two dates:
   - Start year: 1927
   - End year: 1945
   - Number of years = 1945 - 1927 = 18 years

However, since he debuted in March 1927 and retired in November 1945, we should consider whether he completed a full year in 1927. Since he debuted in March, he had not yet completed a full year in 1927. Therefore, the correct calculation would be considering his first full year as 1928.

So, the actual span is from 1928 to 1945, which is 18 years minus the partial year of 1927 plus the partial year of 1945, resulting in 18 complete years plus parts of 1927 and 1945.

But for simplicity in counting years as per common understanding in such contexts, we generally count the full years between the given dates, which gives us 18 years.

1. The date when the submarine sank: 14 July 1943.
2. The date when it was salvaged: 1957.

Now, let's calculate the time difference between these two dates:
- From 14 July 1943 to 14 July 1957 is exactly 14 years.
- Since the salvage happened in 1957, which is after the mid-year mark, we need to add one more year to account for the full year of 1957.

Therefore, the total number of years between the sinking and the salvage is 14 + 1 = 15 years.

- Since 1976 has already started, we include all of 1976 in our count, which adds another year.

Therefore, the total number of years is 74 + 1 = 75 years.

Final Answer: It took 75 years for the Australian Defence Force to take its current form after it was founded."

Armament	6 × 21 in (533 mm) torpedo tubes with stowage for up to 38 weapons | Tomahawk Block IV cruise missiles | Spearfish heavyweight torpedoes

","To determine how many years after the HMS Astute was ordered the picture was taken, we need more specific information about when the picture was taken, which isn't provided in the given data. However, we can use the information available to make some logical assumptions based on the timeline of events.

1. The ship was ordered in March 1997.
2. The ship was launched on 8 June 2007.
3. The ship was commissioned on 27 August 2010.
4. The ship entered service in May 2014.

If we consider that the picture was taken during or shortly after the commissioning ceremony, it would be around August 2010. 

Now let's calculate the difference between the order date and the assumed picture date:
- Order date: March 1997
- Picture date (assumed): August 2010

From March 1997 to March 2010 is 13 years. Since the picture is taken in August, which is later than March, we add another few months but typically we round to the nearest year unless specified otherwise.

Therefore, the picture was likely taken approximately 13 years after the HMS Astute was ordered.

Final Answer: Approximately 13 years after the HMS Astute was ordered."

","To determine how many years after the I-179 was laid down it was completed, we need to follow these steps:

1. Identify the date when the ship was laid down.
2. Identify the date when the ship was completed.
3. Calculate the difference between these two dates.

Step 1: The ship was laid down on 21 August 1941.

Step 2: The ship was completed on 18 June 1943.

Step 3: To calculate the time difference:
- From 21 August 1941 to 18 June 1943 spans two full years plus the period from August 1941 to June 1943.
- Specifically, from August 1941 to June 1943 is roughly 1 year and 10 months.

Therefore, the total time from laying down to completion is approximately 2 years and 10 months.

Since the question asks for the number of years, we can say it took about 2 years to complete the ship after it was laid down, but more precisely, it took around 2 years and 10 months.

Final Answer: The I-179 was completed approximately 2 years and 10 months after it was laid down."

- Since the Grand Coalition affiliation is mentioned for 1980, it could have been established at any point during that year, but we know it's no later than the end of 1980.
- Therefore, the difference between February 1979 and the start of 1980 is less than a full year, but since we're asked about years after founding, we consider the transition complete by the start of 1980.

Thus, the Grand Coalition became the national affiliation approximately 1 year after the Islamic Republican Party was founded.

- Clement Attlee was listed as a leader ""until 1951"".

Now, let's calculate the difference between these two dates:
- From June 1948 to June 1951 is exactly 3 years.
- Since Clement Attlee was a leader until 1951, and the conflict started in June 1948, he became a leader less than a year after the start date, meaning within the first year of the conflict.

Therefore, Clement Attlee became a leader approximately 1 year after the Malayan Emergency began.

Final Answer: Clement Attlee became a leader about 1 year after the Malayan Emergency began."

","The ""Years of Lead"" started in Late 1968 according to the table. The Bologna massacre took place in August 1980. To calculate how many years passed between these two events, we subtract the start year of the ""Years of Lead"" from the year of the Bologna massacre:

1. Start of Years of Lead: 1968
2. Bologna massacre: 1980

To find the number of years elapsed:
1980 - 1968 = 12 years

However, since the period is described as starting in ""Late 1968,"" we need to consider that less than a full year had passed before the first significant event. Therefore, we can say that the Bologna massacre occurred approximately 11 years and some months after the start of the ""Years of Lead.""

But given the question asks for the number of years, the most precise answer would be rounding to the nearest whole number, which is 12 years.

","To determine how many years after the beginning of the war the Sudanese Armed Forces reached their greatest strength, we need to follow these steps:

1. Identify the start date of the First Sudanese Civil War.
2. Determine the peak strength of the Sudanese Armed Forces.
3. Find out when this peak strength occurred.
4. Calculate the number of years between the start of the war and the peak strength.

Step 1: The start date of the First Sudanese Civil War is given as 18 August 1955.

Step 2 & 3: The peak strength of the Sudanese Armed Forces is listed as 36,000 (late 1971).

Step 4: We now calculate the time difference between 18 August 1955 and late 1971.
- From 18 August 1955 to 31 December 1955 is approximately 4.5 months.
- From 1956 to 1971 is 15 full years.
- Adding the partial year 1971 brings us to 16 years total.

Therefore, it took approximately 16 years for the Sudanese Armed Forces to reach their greatest strength.

","The First Kurdish-Iraqi War began on 11 September 1961. The Soviet Union provided non-combat aid until 1964.

To find how many years passed from the start of the war until the Soviet Union ended its non-combat aid, we calculate the difference between these two dates:

1. Start date of the war: 11 September 1961
2. End date of Soviet Union's non-combat aid: 1964

Since we're only concerned with full years, we consider the period from 1961 to 1964:

- From 1961 to 1962: 1 year
- From 1962 to 1963: 2 years
- From 1963 to 1964: 3 years

Thus, 3 years passed from the beginning of the war until the Soviet Union ceased its non-combat aid.

","To determine how many years after the operation of Fatah - The Revolutionary Council ended, Iraq remained an ally, we need to follow these steps:

1. Identify when Fatah - The Revolutionary Council's operations ended.
2. Determine the periods during which Iraq was an ally.
3. Calculate the number of years Iraq remained an ally after the organization ceased operations.

Step 1: Fatah - The Revolutionary Council's operations ended in 1997.

Step 2: Iraq was an ally during two periods:
- 1974-1978
- 1991-2002

Step 3: Since the second period (1991-2002) overlaps with the end of the organization's operations, we calculate the duration of this overlap:
- The organization stopped operating in 1997.
- Iraq remained an ally until 2002.

Thus, Iraq remained an ally for 5 years after Fatah - The Revolutionary Council ended its operations (from 1997 to 2002).

- From 4 March 2003 to 4 March 2022 is exactly 19 years.
- Since we're asked for the number of years up to December 2022, we add one more year because it has passed since March.

Therefore, the total number of years is 20.

","The question asks for how many years ago the Federal Defence Forces of Germany took on its current form. According to the information provided in the table, the Bundeswehr took on its current form on 3 October 1990. 

Now, we need to calculate the number of years from 3 October 1990 to December 2022.

First, let's find the difference between the years:
2022 - 1990 = 32 years

Since the month and day (December vs. October) don't affect the full year count significantly (as we're not considering days), we can conclude that it has been 32 years since 1990.

","To find out how many years ago the Islamic Republican Party was founded, we need to look at the ""Founded"" information provided in the table and calculate the difference between that date and the current date (December 2022).

The table states that the party was founded on 17 February 1979.

Now, let's calculate the number of years from 17 February 1979 to December 2022:

1. First, calculate the full years from 1979 to 2021:
   - 2021 - 1979 = 42 years

2. Since we're currently in December 2022, we need to add one more year to account for the full year of 2022:
   - 42 + 1 = 43 years

However, we should also consider if we've passed the founding date in 2022 or not. Since the party was founded on February 17 and we're considering December, we have already passed that date in 2022.

Therefore, the correct calculation is indeed 43 years.

","To find out how many years ago the sister ship I-176 was salvaged and scrapped, we need to follow these steps:

1. Identify if there's any direct information about I-176 in the given data.
2. If not, infer from the information provided for I-179.
3. Determine the year I-176 was salvaged and scrapped based on the closest available information.
4. Calculate the difference between that year and the current year (2022).

Step 1: There's no specific information about I-176 in the given data.

Step 2 & 3: The closest information we have is about I-179 being salvaged and scrapped in 1957. Since I-176 and I-179 are part of the same class and type (Kaidai/KD7), it's reasonable to assume they might have similar fates. However, this assumption may not be entirely accurate, but without further details, it's the best we can do.

Step 4: To calculate how many years ago I-179 (and by inference, possibly I-176) was salvaged and scrapped:
   Current Year (2022) - Year Salvaged and Scrapped (1957) = 2022 - 1957 = 65 years

Final Answer: Based on the available information and assumptions, it has been approximately 65 years since the sister ship I-176 was salvaged and scrapped. Please note that this is an estimation and actual dates could differ."

1. Identify when Singh played for HC Klein Zwitserland.
2. Determine the period during which Singh played for the Indian national team.
3. Calculate the difference between the start of his national team career and the year he started playing for HC Klein Zwitserland.

Step 1: From the Senior Career section, we can see that Singh played for HC Klein Zwitserland from 2005 to 2007.

Step 2: In the National team section, it states that Singh played for India from 1997 to 2007. 

Step 3: Since Singh began playing for the Indian national team in 1997 and started playing for HC Klein Zwitserland in 2005, the number of years before he played for HC Klein Zwitserland that he was on the national team would be:
2005 - 1997 = 8 years

However, this calculation represents the gap between the start of his national team career and the start of his HC Klein Zwitserland career, but the question asks how many years before he played for HC Klein Zwitserland, which means the full duration of his national team career until 2005.

Therefore, he had been playing for the national team for 8 years before starting at HC Klein Zwitserland.

","To find out how many years before the commissioning of HMS Argyll it was laid down, we need to look at the dates provided for these two events.

From the table:
- Commissioned: 31 May 1991
- Laid down: 20 March 1987

Next, we calculate the difference between these two dates.

First, let's determine the difference in years:
- The ship was commissioned in 1991.
- It was laid down in 1987.
  
The difference in years is 1991 - 1987 = 4 years.

However, we should check if the months and days also affect this calculation. Since the ship was laid down on March 20, 1987, and commissioned on May 31, 1991, we see that the commissioning date is later than the laying down date within the same year. Therefore, the ship was indeed laid down 4 full years before its commissioning.

Step 1: The Malayan Emergency ended on 31 July 1960.

Step 2: According to the table, Southern Rhodesia was a belligerent ""until 1953.""

Step 3: We calculate the difference:
- End date of the Malayan Emergency: 31 July 1960
- Date Southern Rhodesia ceased being a belligerent: 1953

1960 - 1953 = 7 years

Therefore, Southern Rhodesia ceased being a belligerent 7 years before the end of the Malayan Emergency.

1. The end date of the war.
2. When DR Sudan ceased supporting one of the belligerent sides.

From the table:
1. The war ended on 11 September 1987.
2. DR Sudan supported the Anti-Libyan Chadian factions from 1978 until 1985.

Now, let's calculate the difference between these dates:

- The war ended on 11 September 1987.
- DR Sudan stopped supporting in 1985.

The time difference between these two dates is 2 years.

Therefore, DR Sudan ended its support 2 years before the end of the war.

2. Identify when the Republic of the Congo stopped being a belligerent.
3. Calculate the difference between these two dates.

Step 1: The war ended on 25 November 1965.

Step 2: From the Belligerents section:
- In 1960-63, the Democratic Republic of the Congo and the Republic of the Congo were listed as belligerents.
- By 1964-65, only the Democratic Republic of the Congo is mentioned, not the Republic of the Congo.

This suggests that the Republic of the Congo stopped being a belligerent sometime between 1963 and 1964.

Step 3: Since the exact month isn't specified, we'll assume it happened at the end of 1963 for our calculation.
- War ended: 25 November 1965
- Republic of the Congo stopped being a belligerent: End of 1963

The time difference is 1 year and 11 months (approximately 2 years).

Final Answer: The Republic of the Congo stopped being a belligerent about 1 year and 11 months before the war ended. For simplicity, we can say approximately 2 years."

","To determine how many years Chiyonofuji Mitsugu competed, we need to look at his career timeline provided in the table:

1. His debut was in September, 1970.
2. He retired in May, 1991.

To calculate the number of years he competed:
- From 1970 to 1990 is 20 years.
- Since he debuted in September 1970 and retired in May 1991, he competed for part of the year 1970 and part of the year 1991.
- Therefore, we count both the partial year of 1970 and the partial year of 1991 as full years of competition.

Thus, Chiyonofuji Mitsugu competed for 21 years.

","To find out how many years Harumafuji Kōhei competed before retiring in 2017, we need to follow these steps:

1. Identify his debut year from the table.
2. Calculate the difference between the retirement year (2017) and the debut year.

Step 1: From the table, we can see that Harumafuji's debut was in January 2001.

Step 2: To calculate the number of years he competed:
   - Retirement year: 2017
   - Debut year: 2001
   - Number of years competed = 2017 - 2001 = 16 years

However, since he retired in November 2017, it would be more accurate to say he completed 16 full years plus part of the 17th year. But typically, such calculations consider the complete period up until the end of the year before retirement unless specified otherwise.

Final Answer: Harumafuji Kōhei competed for 16 years before retiring in 2017."

","To determine how many years Jenson Button raced, we need to look at his active years in Formula One and any other racing careers mentioned in the table.

1. First, let's examine his Formula One career:
   - Active years: 2000-2017
   - This indicates he started racing in Formula One in 2000 and ended in 2017.
   
2. Next, let's check for any other racing careers:
   - Super GT GT500 Championship career:
     - Debut season: 2017
     - Last entry: Not explicitly stated, but since he debuted in 2017 and had results listed, it's reasonable to assume he raced until at least the end of the 2017 season.

Since the primary racing career mentioned spans from 2000 to 2017, we calculate the total number of years by subtracting the start year from the end year and adding one (to include both the start and end years):

2017 - 2000 + 1 = 18 years

Therefore, Jenson Button raced for 18 years.

","To find out how many years Neo Hom supported belligerents in the Insurgency in Laos, we need to look at the information provided about Neo Hom's involvement and compare it with the overall timeline of the insurgency.

Step 1: Identify Neo Hom's involvement period.
The table states that Neo Hom supported belligerents from 1981 to 2007.

Step 2: Calculate the number of years Neo Hom was involved.

2. Identify the end of his international career:

Subtracting the start year from the end year gives us:
2013 - 1989 = 24 years

However, since he started playing in November 1989 and ended in November 2013, we need to subtract one year because he didn't complete a full year in 1989.

","To determine how many years it took Jenson Button to win his second championship, we need to identify both championships he won and calculate the time difference between them.

From the given information:
- First Formula One World Championship was in 2009.
- His first and only Super GT GT500 Championship was in 2018.

Since the question asks for the second championship and Jenson Button has only one Formula One World Championship and one Super GT GT500 Championship, his second championship would be his Super GT GT500 Championship in 2018.

Now, let's calculate the time difference between his first Formula One World Championship (2009) and his Super GT GT500 Championship (2018):
- 2018 - 2009 = 9 years

Final Answer: It took Jenson Button 9 years to win his second championship."

","To find out how many years it took for HMS Somerset to be commissioned after being ordered, we need to follow these steps:

1. Identify the date when HMS Somerset was ordered.
2. Identify the date when HMS Somerset was commissioned.
3. Calculate the difference between these two dates.

Step 1: From the table, we can see that HMS Somerset was ordered in January 1992.

Step 2: The table also indicates that HMS Somerset was commissioned on 20 September 1996.

Step 3: To calculate the difference:
- From January 1992 to January 1996 is 4 full years.
- From January 1996 to September 1996 is approximately 9 months.

Since the question asks for the number of years, we typically round this to the nearest whole number. Given that it's more than 4 years but less than 5 years, we can say it took about 4 years and 9 months, which would generally be rounded up to 5 years if rounding rules were strictly applied. However, without specific rounding instructions, the most precise answer remains 4 years and 9 months, but typically questions like this expect a whole number of years.

Final Answer: 4 years and 9 months (typically rounded to 5 years if rounding is required)."

- From 25 June 1996 to 20 September 1996 is approximately 3 months.

Therefore, the total time from the launch to the commissioning is 2 years and 3 months.

1. The ""Laid down"" date is given as 23 July 1759.
2. The ""Launched"" date is given as 7 May 1765.

Now, let's calculate the difference between these two dates:

- From 23 July 1759 to 23 July 1765 is exactly 6 years.
- Since the launch date (7 May 1765) is before the end of the year (23 July 1765), we do not add another full year.

Therefore, it took 6 years from the time HMS Victory was laid down until it was launched.

","To find out how many years it took Rubens Barrichello to get his first win in Formula One, we need to look at two key pieces of information from the table:

1. The year he started competing in Formula One.
2. The year he achieved his first win in Formula One.

From the ""Formula One World Championship career"" section:
- His active years are listed as 1993-2011.
- His first entry was the 1993 South African Grand Prix.
- His first win was the 2000 German Grand Prix.

Now let's calculate the difference between these two years:
- First entry: 1993
- First win: 2000

The difference is 2000 - 1993 = 7 years.

However, since the first entry and the first win occurred within the same year would mean it took less than a full year, but since they're separate events and the first win is explicitly mentioned in the following year, we can conclude it took him 7 years from his first entry to achieve his first win.

Final Answer: It took Rubens Barrichello 7 years to get his first win in Formula One."

","To find out how long it took for the Ba'ath Brigades to become the paramilitary wing of the Arab Socialist Ba'ath Party - Syria Region, we need to follow these steps:

1. Identify when the Ba'ath Brigades became the paramilitary wing.
2. Determine when the Arab Socialist Ba'ath Party - Syria Region was founded.
3. Calculate the difference between these two dates.

Step 1: According to the table, the Ba'ath Brigades were the paramilitary wing from 2012 to 2018.

Step 2: The table states that the party was founded on 7 April 1947.

Step 3: To calculate the time taken, we subtract the founding year from the start year of the Ba'ath Brigades:
   2012 - 1947 = 65 years

Therefore, the Ba'ath Brigades became the paramilitary wing 65 years after the party was founded.

","To find out how many years it took for the Citizen Revolution Movement to be registered after its founding, we need to identify two key dates:

1. The founding date of the historical movement.
2. The registration date of the modern movement.

From the information provided:
1. Founding (historical): August 2021
2. Registration: 18 August 2016

However, there seems to be a contradiction here since the historical founding date (August 2021) is more recent than the registration date (August 2016). We should consider the modern founding date which is August 2021, but the registration happened before that in 2016. Therefore, we'll use the modern founding date for context and the registration date for calculation.

Let's calculate the time difference between August 2021 (when the modern movement was founded) and August 2016 (when it was registered):

- From August 2016 to August 2021 is exactly 5 years.

Therefore, it took 5 years from the modern founding to reach the registration date if we interpret the question as asking about the timeline from modern founding to registration.

But strictly speaking, the registration happened before the modern founding, so the actual time from registration to modern founding is 5 years.

Step 1: The HMS Astute was ordered in March 1997.

","To determine how many years it took to build HMS Somerset, we need to identify the start and end dates of its construction process.

From the table:
- The ship was ""Ordered"" in January 1992.
- It was ""Laid down"" on 12 October 1992.
- It was ""Launched"" on 25 June 1994.
- It was ""Commissioned"" on 20 September 1996.

The actual building period starts when the ship was laid down and ends when it was launched. So we use these two dates to calculate the duration:

1. Start Date: 12 October 1992
2. End Date: 25 June 1994

Now let's calculate the time between these dates:
- From 12 October 1992 to 12 October 1993 is exactly one year.
- From 12 October 1993 to 25 June 1994 is about 8 months and 13 days.

Adding these together, we get approximately 1 year and 8 months. 

For simplicity and since specific days aren't crucial for this calculation, we can round this to about 1.75 years.

Final Answer: It took approximately 1.75 years to build HMS Somerset."

1. Identify the founding date of the Federal Defence Forces of Germany.
2. Identify the date when it took its current form.
3. Calculate the difference between these two dates.

From the table:
- The Federal Defence Forces of Germany was founded on 12 November 1955.
- It took its current form on 3 October 1990.

Now let's calculate the difference:
- From 12 November 1955 to 3 October 1990 is 34 years and 10 months and 22 days.

However, the question asks for the number of years, so we can round down to the nearest whole year.

","The duration of the First Sudanese Civil War is given as 18 August 1955 to 27 March 1972. To determine how many years this period spans, we need to calculate the difference between these two dates.

From August 18, 1955, to August 18, 1972, is exactly 17 years. Since the end date is March 27, 1972, which is before August 18, 1972, we do not add another full year to the count. Therefore, the total duration is 17 years plus the time from March 27 to August 18, which is less than a full year.

However, the table already provides the exact duration as ""16 years, 7 months, 1 week and 2 days"". This confirms that the war lasted more than 16 but less than 17 full years.

Therefore, the First Sudanese Civil War lasted for 16 years when considering whole years.

","To find out how many years the Tonnerre sailed before it was burned down, we need to look at two specific dates from the information provided:

1. The commissioning date: 21 July 1808
2. The fate date: Burned and exploded 12 April 1809

Now, let's calculate the time between these two dates.

- From 21 July 1808 to 12 April 1809:
  - First, count the days remaining in July after 21 July: 10 days (from 22 July to 31 July).
  - Then, add all the days in August (31 days), September (30 days), October (31 days), November (30 days), and December (31 days).
  - Finally, add the days from January to April: 31 (January) + 29 (February, assuming it's not a leap year) + 31 (March) + 12 (April up to the 12th).

Let's sum these up:
- Days remaining in July: 10
- Days in August: 31
- Days in September: 30
- Days in October: 31
- Days in November: 30
- Days in December: 31
- Days in January: 31
- Days in February: 29
- Days in March: 31
- Days in April (up to 12): 12

Total = 10 + 31 + 30 + 31 + 30 + 31 + 31 + 29 + 31 + 12 = 276 days

Since there are approximately 365 days in a non-leap year, we can see that this period is less than one full year but more than 9 months.

Therefore, the Tonnerre sailed for less than a full year but more than 9 months before it was burned down. Given the exact dates, we can say it was slightly more than 9 months.

Final Answer: The Tonnerre sailed for slightly more than 9 months before it was burned down."

","First, we need to find the years of Merckx's first General Classification win and his last Combination Classification win at the Tour de France.

From the table:
- The first General Classification win for Tour de France was in 1969.
- The last Combination Classification win for Tour de France was in 1975.

Now, we calculate the number of years between these two events:
1975 (last Combination Classification win) - 1969 (first General Classification win) = 6 years

However, this calculation includes both the start year (1969) and the end year (1975). To find the number of years that elapsed between these two events, we subtract one from the result:

History

French Navy Ensign | France
Name	Tonnerre
Ordered	16 April 1794
Laid down	22 September 1794
Launched	9 June 1808
Commissioned	21 July 1808
Renamed	Quatorze Juillet | (1795)
Fate	Burned and exploded 12 April 1809

General characteristics
Class and type	Téméraire | -class ship of the line
Displacement	2,966 tonnes | 5,260 tonnes fully loaded
Length	55.87 metres (183.3 ft) (172 pied)
Beam	14.90 metres (48 ft 11 in)
Draught	7.26 metres (23.8 ft) (22 pied)
Propulsion	Up to 2,485 m | 2 | (26,748 sq ft) of sails
Armament	74 guns | Lower gundeck: 28 × 36-pounder long guns | Upper gundeck: 30 × 18-pounder long guns | Forecastle and Quarter deck | 16 × 8-pounder long guns | 4 × 36-pounder carronades
Armour	Timber

","To find out how many years elapsed between the laying down and the launching of the Tonnerre, we need to look at the dates provided for these events in the table:

- Laid down: 22 September 1794
- Launched: 9 June 1808

Step 1: Identify the start year and end year.
Start year: 1794
End year: 1808

Step 2: Calculate the difference in years.
1808 - 1794 = 14 years

However, we also need to consider the specific months and days to ensure that we're not counting a partial year. 

Step 3: Compare the months and days.
The ship was laid down on September 22, 1794, and launched on June 9, 1808. Since the launch date occurs before the anniversary date of when it was laid down, we need to subtract one year from our initial calculation.

Therefore, the actual number of years elapsed is:
14 years - 1 year = 13 years

","First, we need to identify the medals won in Kuala Lumpur:
- Gold medal in Champions Challenge in 2001 Kuala Lumpur
- Bronze medal in Asia Cup in 1999 Kuala Lumpur

Next, we determine the years of these events:
- First medal in Kuala Lumpur: 1999 (Bronze medal in Asia Cup)
- Last medal in Kuala Lumpur: 2001 (Gold medal in Champions Challenge)

Now, we calculate the number of years between these two events:
2001 - 1999 = 2 years

However, since we're looking for the number of years that elapsed, we include both the starting year (1999) and the ending year (2001), which means there were 2 years in total.

   - New Order (Flag of Ordine Nuovo.svg): Active period was 1957-1973.
   - National Vanguard (Flag of National Vanguard.svg): Active period was 1960-1976.

2. We can see that the New Order began its activities in 1957.

3. The National Vanguard started its activities in 1960.

4. To find out how long the New Order had been active before the National Vanguard joined, subtract the start year of the National Vanguard from the start year of the New Order:
   - Duration = 1960 - 1957 = 3 years

Therefore, the New Order had been fighting for 3 years when the National Vanguard joined.

","First, let's identify any issues with the question based on the information provided in the table.

The question asks about HMS Astute, but the table contains details about HMS Somerset. There seems to be a mismatch between the ship mentioned in the question and the ship described in the table.

Since the question cannot be answered accurately with the given data, we need to clarify this discrepancy before proceeding.

However, if we were to answer a similar question about HMS Somerset, we would follow these steps:

1. Identify the commission date from the table: HMS Somerset was commissioned on 20 September 1996.
2. Determine the current date: The problem statement suggests the current date is December 2022.
3. Calculate the time in service: From September 1996 to December 2022.

But since the question specifically asks about HMS Astute, which is not detailed in this table, we cannot provide an accurate answer without the correct information.

Final Answer: The question cannot be answered accurately with the given information because it refers to HMS Astute, while the table provides details about HMS Somerset."

","To find out how long Pau Quemada has been playing in his senior career, we need to look at the timeline of his senior career from the given table.

The senior career starts in the year 2000 when he joined Club Egara and continues up until the present time according to the table. 

Let's calculate the duration for each segment of his senior career:
- From 2000 to 2005: 2005 - 2000 = 5 years
- From 2005 to 2006: 2006 - 2005 = 1 year
- From 2006 to 2009: 2009 - 2006 = 3 years
- From 2009 to 2011: 2011 - 2009 = 2 years
- From 2011 to 2016: 2016 - 2011 = 5 years
- From 2016 to 2021: 2021 - 2016 = 5 years
- From 2021 to the present: As of December 2022, it's approximately 1 year (since the table indicates ""present"" and we're assuming the current date is December 2022).

Now let's sum these durations:
5 + 1 + 3 + 2 + 5 + 5 + 1 = 22 years

Therefore, Pau Quemada has been playing in his senior career for 22 years.

Final Answer: 22 years"

","To find out how many years longer GUNT was part of the Pro-Libyan Chadian faction compared to Codos, we need to determine the duration each group was associated with this faction based on the information provided in the table.

1. **GUNT's involvement with the Pro-Libyan Chadian faction**:
   - According to the table, GUNT was part of the Pro-Libyan Chadian factions from 1979 to 1986.

2. **Codos' involvement with the Pro-Libyan Chadian faction**:
   - The table indicates that Codos was involved with the Pro-Libyan Chadian factions from 1983 to 1986.

Now, let's calculate the duration for each group:

- **Duration of GUNT's involvement**: 
  - Start year: 1979
  - End year: 1986
  - Duration = 1986 - 1979 = 7 years

- **Duration of Codos' involvement**:
  - Start year: 1983
  - End year: 1986
  - Duration = 1986 - 1983 = 3 years

Finally, we need to find the difference between these durations:

- Difference in duration: 7 years (GUNT) - 3 years (Codos) = 4 years

Thus, GUNT was part of the Pro-Libyan Chadian faction for 4 years longer than Codos.

","To determine how many years longer Katanga was a belligerent compared to the Kwilu and Simba rebels, we need to identify their respective time periods as belligerents.

From the table:
- **Katanga** was involved from 1960 to 1962.
- **Kwilu and Simba rebels** were involved from 1964 to 1965.

Now let's calculate the duration for each:
- **Katanga**: 1962 - 1960 = 2 years

","To determine how many more years the Red Brigades were active compared to Workers' Autonomy, we need to identify their respective operational periods from the information provided in the table.

From the ""Belligerents"" section:
- The Red Brigades (BR) operated from 1970 to 1988.
- Workers' Autonomy operated from 1973 to 1979.

Now let's calculate the duration of each group's operation:
- Duration of Red Brigades: 1988 - 1970 = 18 years
- Duration of Workers' Autonomy: 1979 - 1973 = 6 years

Finally, we subtract the duration of Workers' Autonomy from that of the Red Brigades to find the difference:
18 years (Red Brigades) - 6 years (Workers' Autonomy) = 12 years

Final Answer: The Red Brigades were active for 12 years longer than Workers' Autonomy."

","To determine how many years one must wait from the earliest they can serve to being eligible for special forces deployment, we need to extract the relevant ages from the information provided:

1. The earliest one can serve in the military: 17 years
2. The age required for special forces deployment: 19 years

Now, we calculate the difference between these two ages:
\[ \text{Difference} = \text{Age for special forces deployment} - \text{Earliest age to serve} \]
\[ \text{Difference} = 19 - 17 \]

This gives us:
\[ \text{Difference} = 2 \]

Therefore, the number of years one must wait from the earliest they can serve to being eligible for special forces deployment is 2 years.

2. Identify the founding date of the CPSU.
3. Calculate the difference between these two dates.

Step 1: The membership figure given is ""19,487,822 (early 1989 | estimation | )"". So, we can use early 1989 as the relevant date for this membership count.

Step 3: Calculate the difference between early 1989 and 8 March 1918:
- From 8 March 1918 to 8 March 1989 is 71 years.
- Since we're considering ""early 1989"", which would be before 8 March 1989, the CPSU would have been slightly less than 71 years old when it reached over 19 million members, but for simplicity and since the exact date within 1989 isn't specified, we'll consider it 71 years.

","To find out how many years passed between Richard's ODI debut and his last year playing for Somerset, we need to follow these steps:

1. Identify the year of Richard's ODI debut.
2. Identify the last year Richard played for Somerset.
3. Calculate the difference between these two years.

Step 1: From the ""International information"" section, we can see that Richard's ODI debut was on 7 June 1975.

Step 2: From the ""Domestic team information"" section, we see that Richard played for Somerset from 1974 to 1986.

Step 3: To calculate the number of years that passed:
- Start year: 1975 (ODI debut year)
- End year: 1986 (last year playing for Somerset)

1986 - 1975 = 11 years

However, since the question asks about the ""last year playing for Somerset,"" we should consider whether he actually played for Somerset in 1986 or if it was just listed as the end year of his tenure there. Given no specific mention that he didn't play in 1986, we'll count this year.

","To find out how many years passed between Sebastian Vettel's first and last entries, we need to identify the dates of his first and last entries and calculate the difference.

1. First entry: The table states that the first entry was on the 2007 United States Grand Prix.
2. Last entry: According to the table, the last entry was on the 2022 Canadian Grand Prix.

Now, we can calculate the difference in years:
- Last entry year: 2022
- First entry year: 2007

Subtracting the first entry year from the last entry year gives us:
2022 - 2007 = 15 years

Therefore, the number of years that passed between Sebastian Vettel's first and last entries is 15.

","To find out how many years passed between the HMS Montrose being ordered and commissioned, we need to look at the dates provided for these events in the table.

1. The ship was ordered in July 1988.
2. The ship was commissioned on 2 June 1994.

Now, let's calculate the difference in years:

- From July 1988 to June 1994 is exactly 5 years and 11 months.
- Since we are asked for the number of years, we can consider this as approximately 6 years (since it's more than 5 years and less than 7 years, rounding to the nearest whole year gives us 6).

Therefore, the number of years that passed between the HMS Montrose being ordered and commissioned is approximately 6 years.

","To find out how many years passed between the laying down and the launch of the Tonnerre, we need to identify these two dates from the information provided in the table:

- Laid down: 22 September 1794
- Launched: 9 June 1808

Next, we calculate the difference between these two dates:

1. From 22 September 1794 to 22 September 1808 is exactly 14 years.
2. Now we need to account for the remaining days:
   - From 22 September 1808 to 9 June 1809 is about 8 months and 17 days.

Since we're asked for the number of years, we can approximate this period as less than a full year but more than 8 months. For simplicity, we consider it as part of the next year since the exact number of days isn't critical for determining the number of completed years.

Therefore, the total time span is approximately 14 years plus nearly one year, which rounds up to 15 years.

Now, let's calculate the difference:
- From July 1988 to July 1992 is exactly 4 years.
- Since the launching occurred on 31 July 1992, which is later than the ordering date in the same month but different year, it means that 4 full years have passed plus a few days in July.

","To determine how many years Aminishiki Ryūji was involved in sumo before retiring, we need to find two pieces of information from the provided data:
1. The year he started his career (debut).
2. The year he retired.

From the table, we can see that:
1. His debut was in January, 1997.
2. He retired in July, 2019.

Now, let's calculate the number of years he was active:
- From 1997 to 2019 is 22 years.
- Since his retirement was in July 2019, and he debuted in January 1997, we should consider if he had a full year of activity in 2019. However, since the question asks about involvement before retiring, we count the entire period from 1997 to 2018 plus part of 2019, which effectively rounds down to 22 full years of involvement.

Therefore, Aminishiki Ryūji was involved in sumo for 22 years before retiring.

To calculate how many years Codos was involved:
- Start year: 1983
- End year: 1986

Now, subtract the start year from the end year to find the duration:
1986 - 1983 = 3 years

We can calculate the duration of his career by subtracting the debut year from the retirement year.

1953 - 1934 = 19 years

However, since he debuted in January 1934 and retired in September 1953, we need to account for the partial years at the beginning and end of his career. He had less than a full year of activity in 1934 and also less than a full year in 1953.

Therefore, his career spanned 19 complete years plus parts of two additional years.

Final Answer: Haguroyama Masaji's sumo career lasted approximately 19 years."

","To find out how many years the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) were active in Sri Lanka, we need to look at their dates of operation.

From the table, we see:
- The start date of operations: 5 May 1976
- The end date of operations: 18 May 2009

To calculate the duration of their activity:
1. Subtract the start year from the end year: 2009 - 1976 = 33 years
2. Check if we need to adjust for partial years:
   - They started on May 5, 1976
   - They ended on May 18, 2009
   Since both start and end dates are in May, and the ending date is after the starting date within the same month, no adjustment is needed for partial years.

Therefore, the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam were active for 33 years.

","To find out how many years there were between when HMS Argyll was ordered and commissioned, we need to look at the dates provided in the table for these two events.

1. HMS Argyll was ordered in September 1986.
2. HMS Argyll was commissioned on 31 May 1991.

Now, let's calculate the difference between these two dates:

From September 1986 to September 1991 is exactly 5 years. Since the ship was commissioned in May 1991, which is before September 1991, we need to subtract one month from this period.

However, since the exact months aren't critical for determining the full year count and the commissioning date is within the same year but later in the year, the primary calculation remains based on the years:

So, the time span between September 1986 and May 1991 is 4 full years plus an additional 8 months (from September to May).

Therefore, rounding to whole years, the period is approximately 5 years.

Final Answer: There were 5 years between when HMS Argyll was ordered and commissioned."

","First, we need to identify the year of the mentioned event. The table mentions it's the 2011 ISAF Sailing World Championships.

Next, we need to determine which medal Claire Leroy, Elodie Bertrand, and Riou won. According to the Medalists section, they won bronze.

The question asks how long they would have to wait for another chance at winning gold. Since the table shows a progression with ""← 2010 | 2011 | 2012 →"", it indicates that this is part of an annual or biennial series of events.

Given it's December 2022 and the last entry provided is for 2012, we must consider if there was a skipped year or if the next event after 2012 occurred in 2014, making it a biennial event.

Assuming it's a biennial event starting from 2012:
- The next event would be in 2014.
- Then, 2016.
- Then, 2018.
- And then, 2020.

Since the question is asked in December 2022, the next event would logically be in 2022 if it were annual, but given the pattern, it's likely 2024.

Therefore, from December 2022 to the next event in 2024, they would have to wait 2 years for their next opportunity to win gold.

Final Answer: They will have to wait 2 years."

","To find out how much longer Neptune's orbital period is compared to its synodic period, we first need to identify both values from the given data:

- Orbital period of Neptune: 164.8 years or 60,195 days
- Synodic period of Neptune: 367.49 days

However, there seems to be a misunderstanding here because usually, an orbital period is shorter than a synodic period for outer planets like Neptune when comparing it to Earth's perspective. But since the question asks us to calculate the difference between these two periods, we can proceed with the provided figures.

Step 1: Convert the orbital period into days if not already done.
The orbital period is already given in days (60,195 days).

Step 2: Subtract the synodic period from the orbital period.
Difference = Orbital period - Synodic period
           = 60,195 days - 367.49 days
           ≈ 60,195 - 367.49
           ≈ 60,195 - 367 (rounded to the nearest integer)
           ≈ 60,828 days

Final Answer: The orbital period of Neptune is approximately 60,828 days longer than its synodic period when rounded to the nearest integer."

","To find out how much longer the time between the Western and Eastern dates for Good Friday is in 2021 compared to 2023, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the difference between the Western and Eastern dates for 2021.
2. Calculate the difference between the Western and Eastern dates for 2023.
3. Subtract the 2023 difference from the 2021 difference to see how much longer it was in 2021.

Step 1: For 2021:
- Western date: April 2
- Eastern date: April 30
The difference between these two dates is 28 days.

Step 2: For 2023:
- Western date: April 7
- Eastern date: April 14
The difference between these two dates is 7 days.

Step 3: To find out how much longer the 2021 difference was compared to 2023:
28 days (2021) - 7 days (2023) = 21 days

Final Answer: The time between the Western and Eastern dates in 2021 is 21 days longer than in 2023."

","To find out how much longer Pau Quemada played for Club Egara compared to Laren, we need to follow these steps:

1. Identify the duration Pau Quemada played for each club.
2. Calculate the difference between these durations.

Step 1: Identifying the duration for each club:
- For Club Egara, we can see two periods: 
  - First period: 0000 | -2005
  - Second period: 2016-2021
  To calculate the total duration for Club Egara, we need to add both periods together:
  - Duration of first period = 2005 - 0000 = 2005 years (though this seems unrealistic, let's consider it as from the start of his career till 2005)
  - Duration of second period = 2021 - 2016 = 5 years
  - Total duration for Club Egara = 2005 + 5 = 2010 years (considering the first period as from the start of his career till 2005, but realistically it would be the time between joining and leaving the club)
  
However, since the exact start year is not provided and the first period likely refers to his youth career which overlaps with senior career, we should focus on the clear senior career duration which is 5 years from 2016 to 2021.
- For Laren, the duration was 2005-2006, which is 1 year.

Step 2: Calculating the difference:
Duration at Club Egara (senior career): 5 years
Duration at Laren: 1 year
Difference: 5 - 1 = 4 years

Final Answer: Pau Quemada played for 4 more years at Club Egara than at Laren."

","To find out how many more years Shaun Pollock played for KwaZulu-Natal compared to Warwickshire, we need to follow these steps:

1. Identify the years Pollock played for each team:
   - KwaZulu-Natal: 1992/93 - 2003/04
   - Warwickshire: 1996 - 2002

2. Calculate the number of years he played for each team:
   - KwaZulu-Natal: 2003/04 - 1992/93 + 1 = 11 years (since seasons span two calendar years, we add 1 year to include both start and end seasons)
   - Warwickshire: 2002 - 1996 + 1 = 7 years

3. Subtract the number of years for Warwickshire from the number of years for KwaZulu-Natal:
   - 11 years - 7 years = 4 years

Therefore, Pollock played for KwaZulu-Natal 4 years longer than he did for Warwickshire.

","First, let's identify how long Yamamoto played for each team mentioned:

For Mito HollyHock:
The table shows that Yamamoto played for Mito HollyHock from 2002 to 2003.
Duration = 2003 - 2002 = 1 year

For Kamatamare Sanuki:
The table shows that Yamamoto played for Kamatamare Sanuki from 2013 to 2017.
Duration = 2017 - 2013 = 4 years

Now, we'll subtract the duration of his time at Mito HollyHock from the duration at Kamatamare Sanuki to find out how much longer he played for Kamatamare Sanuki:

Difference = Duration at Kamatamare Sanuki - Duration at Mito HollyHock
Difference = 4 years - 1 year = 3 years

Therefore, Yamamoto played for Kamatamare Sanuki 3 years longer than he did for Mito HollyHock.

","To solve this problem, we need to determine the duration of two affiliations and then find the difference between them.

1. Determine the duration of the Bloc of Communists and Non-Partisans as the national affiliation:
   - The table shows that the Bloc of Communists and Non-Partisans was the national affiliation from 1936 to 1990.
   - Duration = End year - Start year = 1990 - 1936 = 54 years.

2. Determine the duration of the Cominform as the international affiliation:
   - The table shows that the Cominform was the international affiliation from 1947 to 1956.
   - Duration = End year - Start year = 1956 - 1947 = 9 years.

3. Calculate the difference in duration:
   - Difference = Duration of Bloc of Communists and Non-Partisans - Duration of Cominform
   - Difference = 54 years - 9 years = 45 years.

Final Answer: The Bloc of Communists and Non-Partisans was the national affiliation for 45 years longer than the Cominform was the international affiliation."

","To find out how much longer Iraq was an ally compared to Libya during the '70s, we need to follow these steps:

1. Identify the time periods when Iraq and Libya were allies.
2. Calculate the duration of their alliances during the '70s.
3. Subtract the duration of Libya's alliance from that of Iraq's.

Step 1: Identifying the time periods:
- Iraq was an ally from 1974-1978 and again from 1991-2002.
- Libya was an ally from 1985-1991.

Step 2: Calculating the duration during the '70s:
- For Iraq, this would be 1974-1978, which is 5 years.
- For Libya, there was no alliance during the '70s since it started in 1985.

Step 3: Subtracting the durations:
Since Libya wasn't an ally during the '70s, we only consider Iraq's period, which is 5 years.

Therefore, Iraq was an ally for 5 years longer than Libya during the '70s.

","To determine how old Ali Farag was when he won his first team gold at the World Team Championships, we need to follow these steps:

1. Identify the first time Ali Farag won a team gold at the World Team Championships from the information provided.
2. Determine the date of that event.
3. Compare the date of the event to Ali Farag's birth year and month to calculate his age.

Step 1: From the ""World Team Championships"" section, we can see that Ali Farag has won two team gold medals:
- Gold medal - first place | 2017 Marseille | Team
- Gold medal - first place | 2019 Washington D.C. | Team

The first one is in 2017.

Step 2: The first team gold medal event took place in 2017.

Step 3: We know from the ""Born"" section that Ali Farag was born on April 22, 1992. To find out his age during the 2017 event, we calculate:
2017 - 1992 = 25 years old
Since the event happened in 2017 and his birthday is in April, and the event took place in Marseille (which likely happened later in the year), he would have just turned 25 in 2017.

Final Answer: Ali Farag was 25 years old when he won his first team gold at the World Team Championships."

","To determine how old Chiyonofuji Mitsugu was when he achieved his highest ranking, we need to follow these steps:

1. Find Chiyonofuji's birth year.
2. Identify the month and year of his highest rank achievement.
3. Calculate his age at that time.

Step 1: From the ""Personal information"" section, we see that Chiyonofuji Mitsugu was born on June 1, 1955.

Step 2: In the ""Career"" section, it states that his highest rank, Yokozuna, was achieved in July, 1981.

","To determine Dhyan Chand's age when he won his final gold medal at the 1936 Olympic Games, we need to follow these steps:

1. Identify Dhyan Chand's birth year.
2. Identify the year of the final gold medal win.
3. Calculate the difference between these two years.

Step 1: Identifying Dhyan Chand's birth year:
From the table, we can see that Dhyan Chand was born on 29 August 1905.

Step 2: Identifying the year of the final gold medal win:
The table shows that Dhyan Chand won gold medals in three Olympic Games: 1928, 1932, and 1936. Therefore, his final gold medal was won in 1936.

Step 3: Calculating the difference between these two years:
To calculate Dhyan Chand's age in 1936, subtract his birth year from the year of the final gold medal win:
1936 - 1905 = 31

However, since Dhyan Chand had not yet had his birthday in 1936 (his birthday is in August), we should subtract one year to get his correct age during the Olympics:

Final Answer: Dhyan Chand was 30 years old when he won his final gold medal at the 1936 Olympic Games."

['Gold medal - first place | 1973 Barcelona | Elite road race', 'Silver medal - second place | 1971 Mendrisio | Elite road race', 'Bronze medal - third place | 1970 Leicester | Elite road race']

","First, we need to find the year in which Felice Gimondi won a silver medal at the UCI Road World Championships. From the table, we can see that this happened in 1971 in Mendrisio.

Next, we need to determine Felice Gimondi's age in 1971. The table provides his birthdate as 29 September 1942.

To calculate his age in 1971, we subtract his birth year from the year of the event:
1971 - 1942 = 29 years

However, since his birthday is on 29 September, we need to check if his birthday had occurred by the time of the championships. Since the location is Mendrisio, Switzerland, it's reasonable to assume the event took place sometime during the latter part of the year. Therefore, it is likely that he would have turned 29 during the same year the event took place.

Therefore, Felice Gimondi was 29 years old when he won a silver medal at the UCI Road World Championships.

Final Answer: Felice Gimondi was 29 years old when he won a silver medal at the UCI Road World Championships."

","To determine how old Gagan Ajit Singh was when he began his senior career, we need to follow these steps:

2. Calculate the age based on his birth year and the start year of his senior career.

Step 1: From the ""Senior career"" section, the earliest year mentioned is 2005 for HC Klein Zwitserland.

Step 2: The table provides Gagan Ajit Singh's birthdate as 9 December 1980. He started his senior career in 2005.

Now, let's calculate his age:
- His birthday falls in December, so he would turn 25 during his first year playing professionally if he started right at the beginning of 2005.
- Since his exact start date within 2005 isn't provided and typically players begin their careers sometime after their birthday in that calendar year, we can safely say he was 24 or turning 25 when he started his senior career.

Final Answer: Gagan Ajit Singh was 24 or turning 25 when he began his senior career."

","To determine how old Sachin Tendulkar was when he joined team Mumbai, we need to follow these steps:

1. Find Sachin Tendulkar's birth year.
2. Identify the year he started playing for Mumbai.
3. Calculate his age by subtracting his birth year from the year he joined Mumbai.

Step 1: From the personal information section, we see that Sachin Tendulkar was born on 24 April 1973.

Step 2: Looking at the domestic team information, it states ""1988-2013 Mumbai"". This indicates that he started playing for Mumbai in 1988.

Step 3: To calculate his age in 1988, we subtract his birth year (1973) from 1988:
1988 - 1973 = 15

Therefore, Sachin Tendulkar was 15 years old when he joined team Mumbai.

","To find out how old Sachin Tendulkar was when he played his last One Day International (ODI) match, we need to follow these steps:

1. Identify the date of his last ODI match.
2. Calculate his age on that date.

Step 1: Identifying the date of his last ODI match
From the table, under ""International information"", it states:
""Last ODI	18 March 2012 v Pakistan""

So, his last ODI match was on 18 March 2012.

Step 2: Calculating his age on that date
The table also provides his birthdate:
""Born	( | 1973-04-24 | ) | 24 April 1973 | (age 49)""

We can calculate his age on 18 March 2012:
- He would have turned 38 years old in April 2012 since he was born on 24 April 1973.
- On 18 March 2012, he had not yet turned 38, so he was 37 years old.

Final Answer: Sachin Tendulkar was 37 years old when he played his last One Day International match."

","To find out how old Sean Kelly was when he joined his first professional team, we need to follow these steps:

1. Identify Sean Kelly's birth year from the personal information.
2. Determine the year Sean Kelly joined his first professional team.
3. Calculate the difference between the joining year and the birth year.

Step 1: From the table, we can see that Sean Kelly was born on May 24, 1956.

Step 2: Looking at the ""Professional teams"" section, we see that his first professional team was Flandria-Velda-Latina Assicurazioni, which he joined in 1977.

Step 3: To calculate Sean Kelly's age when he joined his first professional team:
   - He was born in 1956.
   - He joined his first professional team in 1977.
   - The difference is 1977 - 1956 = 21 years.

","To determine how old Sebastian Vettel was when he won his first championship, we need to follow these steps:

1. Identify the year Sebastian Vettel won his first championship.
2. Calculate Sebastian Vettel's age in that year.

Step 1: Identifying the Year of First Championship
From the table, under ""Championships,"" it states ""4 (2010, 2011, 2012, 2013)."" The earliest year mentioned here is 2010, which must be the year of his first championship.

Step 2: Calculating Age in 2010
The table provides Sebastian Vettel's birthdate as ""3 July 1987."" To find out how old he was in 2010, we calculate the difference between 2010 and 1987:
2010 - 1987 = 23 years

However, this calculation does not account for whether his birthday had occurred yet in 2010. Since his birthday is on July 3rd and the championships typically start earlier in the year, we can confirm he would have turned 23 during that championship year.

Final Answer: Sebastian Vettel was 23 years old when he won his first championship."

1. Identify Tarek Momen's birth year from the information provided.
2. Determine the month and year of his highest ranking achievement.
3. Calculate his age at that time.

Step 1: From the ""Born"" row in the table, we see that Tarek Momen was born on 23 February 1988.

Step 2: The ""Men's singles"" section shows that his highest ranking was No. 3, which occurred in February 2019.

Step 3: To calculate his age in February 2019, we subtract his birth year from the year of his highest ranking:

From the ""Personal information"" section, we can see that Yamamoto's date of birth is August 29, 1982.

Step 2: End Year of Youth Career
The ""Youth career"" section shows that it lasted from 1995 to 2000. Therefore, his youth career ended in 2000.

Step 3: Age Calculation
To find out how old he was when his youth career ended, we subtract his birth year from the end year of his youth career:
2000 - 1982 = 18 years old

Since his birthday is on August 29, and assuming his youth career ended before or on August 29, 2000, he would have turned 18 on that day. However, if it ended after August 29, he would still be considered 18 for most practical purposes, as the exact date is not specified.

","Firstly, we need to find the year when the annual exports were around $2 billion.
From the table, under ""Industry"", it states ""Annual exports Around | A$ | 2 billion (2018)"".

Next, we need to confirm the number of active personnel in that same year.
The table provides the number of active personnel as ""59,095 (30 June 2020)"". However, this is from a different year than the export data provided.

Since the export value of $2 billion is given specifically for the year 2018 but the personnel count is from 2020, and there's no other information provided about personnel numbers from 2018, we can conclude that the question might be based on slightly inconsistent data. 

However, the question asks for the year where these two pieces of information align, even if they don't perfectly match up in reality. Therefore, the year asked for would be 2018, since that's the only specific year mentioned regarding the export figure.

","To find out over how many years Iraq was an ally of Fatah – The Revolutionary Council, we need to look at the ""Allies"" row of the table, specifically the information about Iraq.

The table states that Iraq was an ally during two periods:
1. From 1974 to 1978
2. From 1991 to 2002

Let's calculate the duration for each period:
1. Duration from 1974 to 1978: 
   1978 - 1974 = 4 years

2. Duration from 1991 to 2002: 
   2002 - 1991 = 11 years

Now, let's add these durations together:
Total duration = 4 years + 11 years = 15 years

Final Answer: Iraq was an ally of Fatah – The Revolutionary Council for a total of 15 years."

","To find the difference in days between Black Friday in 2024 and 2022, we need to follow these steps:

1. Identify the dates for Black Friday in both years from the table.
   - For 2022, the date is November 25.
   - For 2024, the date is November 29.

2. Calculate the number of days between these two dates.
   - Both dates fall within the same month (November), so we can directly subtract the smaller day number from the larger one.
   - 29 - 25 = 4

Therefore, the difference in days between Black Friday in 2024 and 2022 is 4 days.

","To find the difference in synodic periods between Mars and Earth in years, we first need to understand what a synodic period is and how it's measured for each planet. 

The synodic period of Mars is given directly in the table as 779.96 days, which is approximately 2.1354 years.

Earth's synodic period relative to another planet is the time interval between two successive conjunctions with that planet, as seen from the Sun. For Earth itself, however, the synodic period would be the same as its orbital period around the Sun, which is one year.

So, the synodic period for Earth is 1 year.

Now, to find the difference in synodic periods between Mars and Earth:
Difference = Synodic period of Mars - Synodic period of Earth
Difference = 2.1354 years - 1 year
Difference = 1.1354 years

Final Answer: The difference in the synodic period between Mars and Earth is 1.1354 years."

Atlantic hurricane seasons | 2003, 2004, | 2005 | , 2006, 2007

","To find the first year after 2005 with at least 31 total depressions, we need to follow these steps:

1. Understand that we're looking for information about total depressions for different years.
2. Note that the data provided is specifically for the 2005 Atlantic hurricane season, which had 31 total depressions, a record high.
3. We need to look for data from subsequent years to see if any have 31 or more depressions.
4. The table doesn't provide this information directly; it only shows the 2005 season and related years (2003, 2004, 2006, 2007) without specific depression counts.
5. Since the table doesn't give us the necessary information for those years, we can't determine the exact year based solely on the given data.

However, we know from the information provided that 2005 had a record high number of depressions (31), and it's noted that 2020 also tied this record. Therefore, the first year after 2005 with at least 31 total depressions would be 2020.

","To find the time difference in months between the two maps mentioned, we need to identify the dates associated with each map.

1. The first map is described as ""Deaths per 100,000 residents by department up to July 2020.""
   - This indicates that the data for this map is up to July 2020.

2. The second map is described as ""Map of positive tests by regions as of 5 May 2022.""
   - This indicates that the data for this map is as of 5 May 2022.

Next, we calculate the time difference between these two dates:
- From July 2020 to May 2022 is a period spanning over 2 years minus 2 months (since May is 2 months before July).

Therefore, the total time difference is:
- 2 years = 24 months
- Subtract 2 months (from July to May)

24 months - 2 months = 22 months

Final Answer: The time difference in months between the fatality map and the confirmed cases map is 22 months."
