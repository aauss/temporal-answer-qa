","Step 1: Identify the relevant information in the table. In this case, we need to find the ""Mission duration"" and ""Orbital parameters"" sections.

Step 2: Extract the relevant data. From the ""Mission duration"" section, we have ""Elapsed | 19 years and 1 month since launch | 18 years, 6 months and 7 days at Mars."" From the ""Orbital parameters"" section, we have ""Period | 7.5 hours.""

Step 3: Convert the mission duration to days. We know that there are 365.25 days in a year (accounting for leap years) and 30.44 days in a month (average month length). So, we can calculate the total mission duration in days as follows:

(19 years * 365.25 days/year) + (1 month * 30.44 days/month) + (18 years * 365.25 days/year) + (6 months * 30.44 days/month) + (7 days) = 6931.75 + 30.44 + 6574.5 + 182.64 + 7 = 13665.43 days

To calculate the duration, we need to find the difference between the end date and the start date.

End date: 6 October 1991
Start date: 24 August 1981

Step 3: Convert the dates to a common format (e.g., year and month) to make the calculation easier.

End date: 1991-10-06
Start date: 1981-08-24

Step 4: Calculate the difference in years and months.

From August 1981 to August 1991 is 10 years.
From August 1991 to October 1991 is 2 months.

Step 5: Combine the years and months to get the total duration.

Total duration: 10 years and 2 months

Final Answer: Alphonse Gallegos served as Auxiliary Bishop of Sacramento for 10 years and 2 months."

","Step 1: Identify the start and end dates of Mišić's bishop term from the table.
- Appointed: 29 April 1912
- Term ended: 26 March 1942

Step 2: Calculate the duration between the start and end dates.
- From 29 April 1912 to 29 April 1942 is 30 years.
- From 29 April 1942 to 26 March 1942 is 1 month and 26 days less than a full year.

Step 3: Convert the remaining months and days to years.
- 1 month and 26 days is approximately 1/12 of a year (since a year has 12 months and 365 days, we can approximate 1 month as 1/12 and 26 days as 26/365 of a year).

Step 4: Add the years and the fraction of a year together.
- 30 years + 1/12 of a year ≈ 30.083 years

Step 5: Round the result to the nearest whole number, if necessary.
- In this case, we can round to 30 years, as the fraction is very small.

Step 1: Identify the completion date of the construction.
The table does not provide a specific completion date, so we cannot directly calculate the number of days between the groundbreaking date and the completion date.

Final Answer: The table does not provide the completion date of the construction of All Hallows Twickenham, so it is not possible to determine the number of days after the groundbreaking on 11 July 1939 when the construction was completed."

","Step 1: Identify the start and end dates of the Ethiopian Civil War from the table. The start date is 12 September 1974, and the end date is 28 May 1991.

Step 2: Calculate the number of years, months, and days between the start and end dates.

- Years: 1991 - 1974 = 17 years
- Months: May - September = -4 months (since May is before September, we subtract 4 months)
- Days: 28 - 12 = 16 days (since May 28 is after September 12, we add 16 days)

Step 3: Adjust the months and days to get the total number of days.

- Since we subtracted 4 months, we need to add the days of those months to the total. April has 30 days, March has 31 days, February has 28 days (since it's not a leap year), and January has 31 days. So, 30 + 31 + 28 + 31 = 120 days.

","Step 1: Identify the total mission duration from the table.
The total mission duration is 19 years and 1 month.

Step 2: Convert the total mission duration into months.
1 year = 12 months
19 years = 19 * 12 = 228 months
1 month = 1 month
Total mission duration in months = 228 months + 1 month = 229 months

Step 3: Determine the current date and calculate the elapsed time since the launch.
The launch date is June 2, 2003. As of December 2022, the elapsed time is 19 years and 6 months.

Step 4: Convert the elapsed time into months.
19 years = 19 * 12 = 228 months
6 months = 6 months
Elapsed time in months = 228 months + 6 months = 234 months

Step 5: Calculate the remaining months in the mission duration.
Remaining months = Total mission duration in months - Elapsed time in months
Remaining months = 229 months - 234 months = -5 months

","Step 1: Identify the years of support for the EPRDF and the other side in the Ethiopian Civil War.

- EPRDF support: 1977-1990 (Libya) and 1985-1991 (Libya)
- Other side support: 1974-1987 (Derg)

Step 2: Calculate the total years of support for the EPRDF.

- From 1977 to 1990: 1990 - 1977 = 13 years

- Total years of EPRDF support: 13 + 6 = 19 years

Step 3: Calculate the total years of support for the other side (Derg).

- From 1974 to 1987: 1987 - 1974 = 13 years

Step 4: Calculate the difference in years of support between the EPRDF and the other side.

","Step 1: Identify the start date of the dissolution of the Soviet Union from the table. The start date is given as 16 November 1988.

Step 2: Identify the date when Chechnya became an unrecognized breakaway state. The table mentions that Chechnya became an unrecognized breakaway state in 1991.

Step 3: Calculate the number of years between the start date and the date Chechnya became an unrecognized breakaway state. Since the start date is in November 1988 and Chechnya became an unrecognized breakaway state in 1991, we can calculate the time difference as follows:

1991 - 1988 = 3 years

Step 4: Since the start date is in November and Chechnya became an unrecognized breakaway state in 1991, we can assume that Chechnya became an unrecognized breakaway state sometime in 1991, which is within the 3-year period.

Final Answer: Chechnya became an unrecognized breakaway state 3 years after the beginning of the dissolution of the Soviet Union."

","Step 1: Determine Pettersen's age when he won the gold medal at the Junior World Championships.

Pettersen was born on November 24, 1961. The Junior World Championships took place in 1980. To find out his age in 1980, we subtract his birth year from 1980:

1980 - 1961 = 19 years old

Step 2: Determine how many years after turning 18 Pettersen won the gold medal.

Pettersen turned 18 in 1979 (1961 + 18 = 1979). Since he was 19 years old in 1980, we subtract 18 from his age in 1980 to find out how many years after turning 18 he won the gold medal:

19 - 18 = 1 year

Final Answer: Pettersen won a gold medal at the Junior World Championships 1 year after turning 18."

","Step 1: Identify the previous team Antonio Mohamed managed before Atlético Mineiro.
From the table, we can see that Antonio Mohamed managed Celta in 2018.

Step 2: Determine the year he started managing Celta.
The table does not provide the exact year he started managing Celta, but since he managed Celta in 2018 and the question asks for the years he managed his previous team before managing Atlético Mineiro, we can assume he started managing Celta in 2018.

Step 3: Identify the year he started managing Atlético Mineiro.
From the table, we can see that Antonio Mohamed started managing Atlético Mineiro in 2022.

Step 4: Calculate the number of years he managed Celta before managing Atlético Mineiro.
Since he started managing Celta in 2018 and started managing Atlético Mineiro in 2022, we can calculate the number of years by subtracting the starting year of Celta from the starting year of Atlético Mineiro: 2022 - 2018 = 4 years.

Final Answer: Antonio Mohamed managed his previous team, Celta, for 4 years before managing the team he currently manages, Atlético Mineiro."

","Step 1: Identify the release dates of ""3 a.m. Eternal"" from the table.

- First release: May 1989 (Pure Trance 2)
- Last release: January 1992 (The KLF vs ENT version)

Step 2: Calculate the number of years between the first and last release.

- From May 1989 to May 1992 is 3 years.
- Since the last release is in January 1992, we need to consider the months. From May 1989 to January 1992 is 2 years and 8 months.

Step 3: Convert the months to a fraction of a year.

- 8 months is approximately 8/12 or 2/3 of a year.

Step 4: Add the years and the fraction of a year together.

- 3 years + 2/3 of a year = 3 + 0.67 = 3.67 years

Final Answer: Approximately 3.67 years passed between the first and last release of ""3 a.m. Eternal""."

- From 1918 to 1991 is 1991 - 1918 = 73 years.

Step 3: Since the independence from Russia occurred in March and the independence from the USSR occurred in August, we need to consider the months to determine if an additional year should be added.

- March to August is 5 months, which is less than a full year.

Step 4: Since the difference in months is less than a full year, we do not add an additional year.

Step 2: Identify Alojzije Mišić's birth date, which is 10 November 1859.

Step 3: Calculate the age difference between the appointment date and the birth date.

Step 4: Since the appointment date (29 April 1912) is before the birth date (10 November 1859) in the same year, we need to calculate the age in years and months.

Step 4: Since the current year is 2022, we can calculate the number of years Benedict Cumberbatch has been active in his acting career by subtracting the starting year (1998) from the current year (2022).

2022 - 1998 = 24 years

Step 5: Benedict Cumberbatch started acting in 1998, and he is currently 45 years old (as stated in the table). To find out how old he was when he started acting, we subtract the number of years he has been active (24 years) from his current age (45 years).

45 - 24 = 21 years old

Final Answer: Benedict Cumberbatch was 21 years old when he started acting."

","Step 1: Identify the relevant information from the table. In this case, we need to find out Mohammad Yamin's age when he became Minister of National Education in 1953.

Step 2: Look for Mohammad Yamin's birth date in the table. According to the table, Mohammad Yamin was born on 24 August 1903.

Step 3: Calculate the age difference between 1953 and 1903. To do this, subtract the birth year from the year he became Minister of National Education: 1953 - 1903 = 50 years.

Step 4: Since Mohammad Yamin's birthday in 1953 had not yet occurred by the time he became Minister of National Education, we need to subtract one year from the calculated age difference. So, 50 - 1 = 49 years.

Final Answer: Mohammad Yamin was 49 years old when he became Minister of National Education in 1953."

","Step 1: Identify the relevant information from the table. In this case, we need to find out when Sam Snead turned professional and his age at that time.

Step 2: Locate the information in the table. The table states that Sam Snead turned professional in 1934.

Step 3: Determine Sam Snead's birth year. The table provides his full name, Samuel Jackson Snead, but we can infer his birth year from the given information. Sam Snead died on May 23, 2002, and he was 89 years old at that time. To find his birth year, we subtract his age at death from the year of his death: 2002 - 89 = 1913.

Step 2: Identify the death date of Stephen Hawking from the table, which is 14 March 2018.

Step 3: Calculate the age of Stephen Hawking at the time of his death by subtracting the birth year from the death year and then adjusting for whether his birthday had occurred before or after his death in the year of his death.

Step 4: Since Stephen Hawking was born on 8 January 1942 and died on 14 March 2018, his birthday had already occurred in 2018 before his death. Therefore, we only need to subtract the birth year from the death year.

Step 5: Perform the calculation: 2018 - 1942 = 76.

Step 6: Calculate the age in months and days. From 20 July 1911 to 1 July 1976, there are 65 years, 0 months, and 12 days.

Final Answer: Theo Bot was 65 years, 0 months, and 12 days old when he last served as Permanent Representative of the Netherlands to the IAEA"

","Step 1: Identify Percy's birth date and death date.
- Birth date: April 7, 1908
- Death date: February 9, 1976

Step 2: Calculate Percy's age at the time of his death in 1976.
- From April 7, 1908, to April 7, 1976, is 68 years.

","Step 1: Identify the relevant information in the table.
- The table provides information about the Satish Dhawan Space Centre (SDSC), including its launchpad, location, coordinates, short name, operator, total launches, launch pad(s), launch history, and SLV LP launch history.

Step 2: Find the information related to the naming of the Satish Dhawan Space Centre.
- The table does not explicitly mention the year the Satish Dhawan Space Centre was named. However, it does provide the first launch date, which is 9 August 1979.

Step 3: Determine if the first launch date can be used to infer the naming year.
- Since the first launch date is given as 9 August 1979, it is reasonable to assume that the space centre was named before this date, as it would have been established to support the launch.

Step 4: Final answer.
- The Satish Dhawan Space Centre was likely named before 1979, but the exact year of naming is not provided in the table."

['Faith at work in 1949 | Faith at work in 1949']

Background information

Died	February 9, 1976 | (1976-02-09) |  (aged 67) | Encino, California, U.S.

","Step 1: Identify the relevant dates from the table. In this case, we need to find out Percy's Faith's birth date and the year 1949.

Step 2: Calculate the age of Percy Faith in 1949. We know that Percy Faith was born on April 7, 1908. To find out his age in 1949, we subtract his birth year from 1949.

1949 - 1908 = 41

Step 3: Since we are looking for his age in 1949, and his birthday in April, we can conclude that he had already turned 41 in 1949.

Final Answer: Percy Faith was 41 years old in 1949."
