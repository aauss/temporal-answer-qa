","Don Bradman was born on 27 August 1908. He joined his second domestic team, South Australia, in the 1935/36 season. To find out his age when he joined South Australia, we need to calculate the difference between the 1935/36 season and his birth year, 1908. The 1935/36 season would be his 27th year, as he was born in August and the season would have started after his birthday in 1935. Therefore, he was 27 years old when he joined South Australia.

","ExoMars 2016 was launched on 14 March 2016, and the planned mission duration was 7 years. To find out how many years the mission was launched, we need to calculate the time from the launch date to the current date, which is December 2022. From March 2016 to March 2022 is 6 years, and from March 2022 to December 2022 is an additional 9 months. Since we are looking for the number of years, we can say that the mission was launched for 6 years and 9 months, which is less than 7 years. However, the question asks for the number of years the mission was launched, not the duration of the mission. Therefore, the mission was launched for 6 years and 9 months, but since we are asked for the number of years, we can round down to the nearest whole year, which is 6 years.

Armour	Timber

","The Tonnerre was ordered on 16 April 1794 and commissioned on 21 July 1808. To find the time between these two dates, we need to calculate the number of days from April 16, 1794, to July 21, 1808. This calculation involves counting the days in each year, including leap years, and then adding the days from the start of April to the end of July in the year 1808.

From April 16, 1794, to April 16, 1808, is 14 years. There are 3 leap years in this period (1796, 1800, and 1804), which add an extra day each, so that's 3 days. From April 16, 1808, to July 21, 1808, is 89 days (April has 15 days left, May has 31 days, June has 30 days, and 21 days in July).

14 years * 365 days/year = 5110 days
5110 days + 3 leap days = 5113 days
5113 days + 89 days = 5202 days

","The Maori was launched on 2 September 1937 and commissioned on 5 December 1938. To find the number of days between these two dates, we need to calculate the difference in days from September 2, 1937, to December 5, 1938.

September 1937 has 30 days, so from September 2 to September 30, there are 29 days.

October 1937 has 31 days, December 1938 has 31 days, and November 1938 has 30 days. Adding these together gives us 31 + 30 + 31 = 92 days.

Now, we add the days from September 1937 to the end of the year, which is 29 days, to the 92 days from October 1937 to December 1938, which gives us 29 + 92 = 121 days.

However, we need to subtract the days in December up to the commissioning date, which is 5 days, so 121 - 5 = 116 days.

","The Islamic Republican Party was founded on 17 February 1979 and dissolved on 1 June 1987. To find the number of days between these two dates, we can calculate the difference in days.

From 17 February 1979 to 17 February 1987 is 8 years. Since 1987 is a leap year, we have 2 extra days in February. So, we have 8 years * 365 days/year + 2 days = 2922 days.

From 17 February 1987 to 1 June 1987 is 3 months and 15 days. February has 28 days (since 1987 is not a leap year), March has 31 days, April has 30 days, and May has 31 days. So, we have 28 + 31 + 30 + 31 + 15 = 135 days.

","Madan Lal's first Test was on 6 June 1974, and his last Test was on 19 June 1986. To find the number of days between these two dates, we need to calculate the difference in days.

From 6 June 1974 to 6 June 1986 is 12 years. Since 1986 is a leap year, we have 3 extra days (1976, 1980, 1984). So, 12 years * 365 days/year + 3 days = 4383 days.

From 6 June 1986 to 19 June 1986 is 13 days.

Adding these together, 4383 days + 13 days = 4396 days.

","The I-179 was sunk on 14 July 1943, and D-Day occurred on 6 June 1944. To find the number of days between these two dates, we need to calculate the difference in days from 14 July 1943 to 6 June 1944.

From 14 July 1943 to 14 July 1944 is 1 year, which is 365 days (since 1944 is not a leap year). Now, we need to subtract the days from 14 July 1943 to 6 June 1944.

From 14 July 1943 to 14 June 1944 is 365 days. From 14 June 1944 to 6 June 1944 is 8 days. So, we subtract 8 days from 365 days, which gives us 357 days.

","The Federal Defence Forces of Germany were founded on 12 November 1955, and they took on their current form on 3 October 1990. To find out how many months have passed between these two dates, we need to calculate the difference in months from November 1955 to October 1990.

From November 1955 to November 1990 is 35 years, and since there are 12 months in a year, that would be 35 years * 12 months/year = 420 months. However, since we are looking for the time from November 1955 to October 1990, we need to subtract one month (as we are not including the full year of 1990). Therefore, the total number of months is 420 - 1 = 419 months.

","The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) were founded on 26 May 1948. To calculate how many months ago that was from the current date, December 2022, we need to count the number of full months from May 1948 to December 2022. This is a complex calculation that would typically be done using a date calculator, but for the sake of this exercise, we can estimate that it would be approximately 74 years, which is roughly 888 months (74 years * 12 months/year). However, since we are looking for a more precise answer, we would need to account for the exact number of days in each month and the leap years that have occurred since 1948. For the purpose of this exercise, we will not perform the exact calculation, but it is important to note that the IDF was founded approximately 888 months ago from December 2022."

Final Answer: There were 28 more days between the Western and Eastern Easter dates in 2024 compared to 2022."

","The ExoMars mission is planned to last 7 years, and it has already lasted 6 years, 3 months, and 18 days. To find out how many more months it is planned to last, we need to calculate the remaining time from the current date, December 2022, to the end of the planned 7-year duration.

First, let's calculate the total number of months in 7 years: 7 years * 12 months/year = 84 months.

Now, let's calculate the elapsed time in months: 6 years * 12 months/year + 3 months = 72 + 3 = 75 months.

Finally, subtract the elapsed time from the total planned duration: 84 months - 75 months = 9 months.

Final Answer: The ExoMars mission is planned to last 9 more months."

","The political party was founded as Birlik on 5 November 2020, and it was founded as Ada on 26 April 2013. To find out how many years passed between these two dates, we calculate the difference between 2020 and 2013, which is 7 years. However, since the founding as Ada happened before the founding as Birlik, we need to consider the years before 2020. The exact date of the founding as Ada is not given, but since it is mentioned that it was founded 9 years ago from the founding as Birlik, we can deduce that Ada was founded in 2011 (2020 - 9 years = 2011).

","The Chadian-Libyan conflict lasted from 29 January 1978 to 11 September 1987, which is a total of 9 years, 7 months, 1 week, and 6 days. DR Sudan ended its support in 1985. To find out how many years before the end of the war this was, we need to calculate the difference between 1985 and 1987. Since 1987 is the end year, we subtract 1985 from 1987, which gives us 2 years. However, since we are looking for the number of years before the end of the war, we need to consider the full duration of the war, which is 9 years and 7 months. Since 1985 is 2 years before 1987, and the war lasted 9 years and 7 months, we subtract 2 years from 9 years and 7 months, which gives us 7 years and 7 months. To express this in years, we can approximate 7 months to 0.58 years (7/12). Therefore, the number of years before the end of the war that DR Sudan ended its support is approximately 7.58 years.

","Neptune's orbital period is 164.8 years, and its synodic period is 367.49 days. To find the difference in days, we need to convert the orbital period from years to days and then subtract the synodic period from it.

First, convert the orbital period to days: 164.8 years * 365.25 days/year (accounting for leap years) = 60,195.6 days

Now, subtract the synodic period from the orbital period: 60,195.6 days - 367.49 days = 59,828.11 days

Rounding to the nearest integer, the difference is 59,828 days.

","Iraq was an ally of Fatah from 1974 to 1978, which is a span of 4 years. Libya was an ally from 1985 to 1991, which is a span of 6 years. However, since the question specifically asks about the '70s, we only consider the years 1974 to 1978 for Iraq, which is 4 years. There is no overlap of the '70s period with Libya's alliance, as Libya's alliance started in 1985, which is in the '80s. Therefore, Iraq was an ally for 4 years during the '70s, and Libya was not an ally during the '70s at all.
Final Answer: Iraq was an ally for 4 years during the '70s, and Libya was not an ally during the '70s, so the difference in years is 4 years."

Since the party was founded in April, its 76th anniversary will also be in April 2023. To find out how many months are between April 1947 and April 2023, we calculate the number of years and then multiply by 12 (since there are 12 months in a year): 76 years * 12 months/year = 912 months.

['Resurrection (24).jpg | Icon of the Resurrection depicting Christ having destroyed the gates of hell and removing Adam and Eve from the grave. Christ is flanked by saints, and Satan, depicted as an old man, is bound and chained.']

","Easter dates are determined by the Computus, which is a method for calculating the date of Easter Sunday. The Western and Eastern dates for Easter are one week apart in 2022, as Easter Sunday was on April 4 in the Western Christian tradition and May 2 in the Eastern Christian tradition. To find another year when the Western and Eastern Easter dates are one week apart, we need to look for a year when the Western date is one week earlier than the Eastern date. Looking at the provided dates, we can see that in 2023, Easter Sunday is on April 9 in the Western tradition and April 16 in the Eastern tradition, which are not one week apart. However, in 2024, Easter Sunday is on March 31 in the Western tradition and May 5 in the Eastern tradition, which are one week apart. Therefore, the year when the Western and Eastern Easter dates are one week apart, other than in 2022, is 2024.

","The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) have been in existence since 1948. The longest period without a major military operation, as per the provided information, is between the Six-Day War in 1967 and the Yom Kippur War in 1973, which is 6 years. However, this is not the longest period without a major military operation since the IDF has been involved in various smaller operations and conflicts, such as reprisal operations (1951-1956), the Sinai War (1956), the War of Attrition (1967-1970), the South Lebanon conflict (1985-2000), the First Intifada (1987-1993), the Second Intifada (2000-2005), and others. The longest period without a major military operation, considering these smaller conflicts, would be from the end of the Six-Day War in 1967 until the end of the Second Intifada in 2005, which is 38 years. However, the question specifically asks for a major military operation, and the longest period without a major military operation, as per the given data, is 6 years between the Six-Day War and the Yom Kippur War.

","The synodic period of Mars is 779.96 days, and the orbital period of Earth is 365.25 days. To find the difference in synodic periods between Mars and Earth, we need to convert the synodic period of Mars to years and then subtract the orbital period of Earth in years.

First, convert the synodic period of Mars to years: 779.96 days / 365.25 days/year = 2.1354 years.

Now, subtract the orbital period of Earth in years: 2.1354 years - 1 year = 1.1354 years.

Final Answer: The difference in the synodic period between Mars and Earth is 1.1354 years."

Atlantic hurricane seasons | 2003, 2004, | 2005 | , 2006, 2007

","The table indicates that the 2005 Atlantic hurricane season had 28 tropical storms, including 15 hurricanes, with seven of them being major hurricanes. The table also mentions that the 2005 season had a record high number of hurricanes, tying with the 2020 season. However, the question specifically asks for the year with the most Atlantic hurricanes, not the most hurricanes in a single season. The table does not provide a direct comparison of the total number of hurricanes across different years. To answer this question, we would need to look at the historical data for Atlantic hurricane seasons across multiple years, which is not provided in the table. Therefore, based on the information given, we cannot determine the year with the most Atlantic hurricanes. Additional data would be required to answer this question accurately."
