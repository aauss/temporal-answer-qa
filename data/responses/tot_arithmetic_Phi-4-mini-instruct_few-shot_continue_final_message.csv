We know that yesterday was 2013-09-04, so today is 2013-09-05. Now, we need to add 1524 days to 2013-09-05. We can do this by adding the number of years, months, and days separately. First, let's find the number of years: 1524 / 365 = 4 years (with a remainder of 4 days). So, we add 4 years to 2013, which gives us 2017. Now, let's find the number of months: 1524 - (4 * 365) = 1524 - 1460 = 64 months. Since there are 12 months in a year, we divide 64 by 12, which gives us 5 years and 4 months. So, we add 5 years and 4 months to 2017, which gives us 2022. Now, let's find the number of days: 1524 - (4 * 365 + 5 * 12 * 30) = 1524 - (1460 + 1800) = 1524 - 3260 = -1736 days. Since we have a negative number, we need to subtract 1736 days from 2022. We can do this by subtracting the number of years, months, and days separately. First, let's find the number of years: 1736 / 365 = 4 years (with a remainder of 316 days). So, we subtract 4 years from 2022, which gives us 2018. Now, let's find the number of months: 1736 - (4 * 365) = 1736 - 1460 = 276 days. Since there are 30 days in a month, we divide 276 by 30, which gives us 9 months. So, we subtract 9 months from 2018, which gives us 2018-09. Now, let's find the number of days: 1736 - (4 * 365 + 9 * 30) = 1736 - (1460 + 270) = 1736 - 1730 = 6 days.

We can do this by calculating the number of full years, months, and days between the two dates, and then converting everything to days. First, we calculate the number of full years: 2023 - 2018 = 5 years. Each year has 365 days, so 5 years have 5 * 365 = 1825 days. Next, we calculate the number of full months: October - April = 6 months. Each month has an average of 30.44 days, so 6 months have 6 * 30.44 = 182.64 days. Finally, we calculate the number of days from April 26 to October 19: April has 30 days, so 30 - 26 = 4 days. May has 31 days, June has 30 days, July has 31 days, August has 31 days, September has 30 days, and October has 19 days. Adding these up, we get 4 + 31 + 30 + 31 + 31 + 30 + 19 = 176 days.

We can do this by converting both times to seconds and then subtracting the start time from the end time. 04:27:03 = 4 * 3600 + 27 * 60 + 3 = 16203 seconds. 18:27:15 = 18 * 3600 + 27 * 60 + 15 = 65745 seconds. The duration is 65745 - 16203 = 49542 seconds. Now we need to convert the answer back to the required format. We need to divide 49542 by 3600 with a remainder: 49542 // 3600 = 13 hours. The remainder is 49542 - (13 * 3600) = 49542 - 46800 = 2742 seconds. 2742 seconds is 45 minutes and 42 seconds.

The remainder is 196 - (3 * 60) = 196 - 180 = 16 minutes. 126 seconds divided by 60 is 2 minutes and 6 seconds. The remainder is 126 - (2 * 60) = 126 - 120 = 6 seconds. Adding the hours, minutes, and seconds together, we get 7 + 3 + 2 = 12 hours, 16 + 2 = 18 minutes, and 6 seconds. Thus, the answer is H = 12, M = 18, S = 6"", ""H"": 12, ""M"": 18, ""S"": 6}"
