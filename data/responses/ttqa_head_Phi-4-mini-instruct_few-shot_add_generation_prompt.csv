","Jeffrey Epstein was apprehended on July 6, 2019, and he died on August 10, 2019. To find out how many months after being apprehended he died, we calculate the difference between the two dates. From July to August is one month, and since he was apprehended in the middle of July, he died in the middle of August, so the time frame is less than a full month. However, since the question asks for the number of months, we can round up to the nearest whole month, which is 1 month.
Final Answer: 1 month"

Born	Eugène Henri Paul Gauguin | ( | 1848-06-07 | ) | 7 June 1848 | Paris, French Second Republic
Died	8 May 1903 | (1903-05-08) | (aged 54) | Atuona, Marquesas Islands, French Polynesia
Known for	Painting, sculpture, ceramics, engraving
Movement	Post-Impressionism, Primitivism, Synthetism

['Paul Gauguin 1891.png | Gauguin in 1891']

","Paul Gauguin married Teha'amana in 1891. He separated from her in 1893. To find out the age at which he separated, we need to calculate the difference in years between 1891 and 1893, which is 2 years. Since he was born in 1848, we add 2 years to his age in 1891. Gauguin was 43 years old in 1891 (1891 - 1848 = 43). Adding 2 years to his age at the time of marriage gives us 45 years old. However, since he separated in 1893, we need to calculate his age at that time, which would be 45 + 2 = 47 years old.

","Roger Federer achieved his highest ranking on 2 February 2004, at the age of 22 (1981-2004). To find his age, subtract the year of birth from the year of his highest ranking: 2004 - 1981 = 23. However, since the highest ranking was achieved in February and he was born in August, he had not yet turned 23 in 2004, so he was 22 years old.

","Ingenuity was deployed on 3 April 2021 and its last flight was on 11 June 2022. To find the number of days it flew, we need to calculate the difference between these two dates.

From 3 April 2021 to 11 June 2021 is 1 month and 8 days. From 11 June 2021 to 11 June 2022 is 1 year. Since 2021 is not a leap year, we have 365 days in that year.

So, the total number of days Ingenuity flew on Mars is 1 month and 8 days (which is approximately 31 days for April, 30 days for May, and 8 days for June) plus 365 days for the year 2021, which equals 31 + 30 + 8 + 365 = 434 days.

June 2, 2003, to June 30, 2003, is 29 days (since June has 30 days).

July 1, 2003, to December 24, 2003, is 168 days (31 days in July, 31 in August, 30 in September, 31 in October, 30 in November, and 24 in December).

","Ingenuity was deployed on 3 April 2021 and had its first flight on 19 April 2021. To calculate the time between these two dates, we can count the number of days and then convert that to months. From 3 April to 19 April is 16 days. Since we are looking for the number of months, we can approximate this by dividing the number of days by 30 (the average number of days in a month). So, 16 days / 30 days/month ≈ 0.53 months. However, since we are looking for a whole number of months, we can round this to the nearest whole month, which is 1 month.

To calculate the time between these two dates in months, we can count the months from April to June, which are April, May, and June.

","Miloš Obrenović I's reign as Grand Vožd of Serbia started on 23 April 1815 and ended on 6 November 1817. Karađorđe was his predecessor, and Miloš Obrenović I succeeded him as Prince of Serbia on 6 November 1817. To find the length of Miloš Obrenović I's reign, we calculate the time between 23 April 1815 and 6 November 1817. From April 1815 to April 1816 is 1 year, and from April 1816 to April 1817 is another year, making it 2 years. Then, we add the time from April 1817 to November 1817, which is 7 months. Since we are looking for the length in years, we convert the 7 months to a fraction of a year, which is 7/12. Adding this to the 2 years, we get 2 + 7/12 = 2.58 years, which is approximately 2 years and 7 months. However, since the question asks for the length in years, we will round down to the nearest whole year, which is 2 years.

To find out how long it has been open, we need to calculate the difference between the year it was consecrated and the current year, which is 2022. So, 2022 - 1949 = 73 years. However, since it was founded in the 13th century, we need to add the centuries it has been open. Assuming it was founded in the 1200s, let's take the mid-point of the 13th century, which is 1250. So, 2022 - 1250 = 772 years. But since it was consecrated in 1949, we only count from that year, which gives us 2022 - 1949 = 73 years. Therefore, the church has been open for 73 years.

","Richard Caswell was married to Mary Mackilwean in 1752 and to Sarah Herritage in 1758. To find out how long he was married to each wife, we need to calculate the difference between the years they were married and the year of their respective deaths.

Mary Mackilwean: 1757 (year of death) - 1752 (year of marriage) = 5 years
Sarah Herritage: 1758 (year of marriage) - 1757 (year of death) = -1 year (This indicates that Sarah Herritage died before they were married, which is not possible. It seems there might be an error in the provided information. Assuming the marriage year is the same as the death year, the duration would be 0 years.)

Final Answer: 5 years (with the assumption that the marriage to Sarah Herritage was the same year she died, which is likely an error in the data provided)."

","The movie ""49th Parallel"" premiered in the United Kingdom on October 8, 1941, and in the United States on March 5, 1942. To find the number of days between these two dates, we can calculate the days in each month between October and March, and then add the days in October after the 8th.

October has 31 days, so from the 8th to the end of October, there are 31 - 8 = 23 days.

November has 30 days, December has 31 days, January has 31 days, February has 28 days (1942 was not a leap year), and March has 5 days up to the premiere.

Adding these together: 23 (October) + 30 (November) + 31 (December) + 31 (January) + 28 (February) + 5 (March) = 148 days.

","The Belarusian People's Republic was formed on 9 March 1918, and Belarus gained independence from Russia on 25 August 1991. To find the number of days between these two dates, we need to calculate the difference in days from 9 March 1918 to 25 August 1991.

Since this calculation involves a large span of years, we can use a date difference calculator or perform the calculation manually. For the sake of this example, let's assume we have calculated the difference and found that there are 73,045 days between the two dates.

","The Better Day World Tour started on July 17, 2011, and ended on December 1, 2011. To find the number of days the tour lasted, we need to calculate the difference between the end date and the start date.

From July 17, 2011, to July 17, 2012, would be 365 days (since 2011 is not a leap year). However, since the tour ended on December 1, 2011, we need to subtract the days from July 17 to December 1.

July has 31 days, so from July 17 to July 31, there are 14 days. August has 31 days, September has 30 days, October has 31 days, November has 30 days, and December has 1 day.

14 (July) + 31 (August) + 30 (September) + 31 (October) + 30 (November) + 1 (December) = 137 days

Adding these together: 5840 + 240 + 16 = 6096 days

However, we need to account for leap years. There are 4 leap years in this period (1976, 1980, 1984, 1988). Each leap year adds an extra day, so we add 4 days to our total.

6096 + 4 = 6100 days

Final Answer: The Ethiopian Civil War lasted 6100 days."

To find the number of full years between these two dates, we calculate the difference between 1953 and 1923, which is 30 years. However, since the ordination was on December 16 and the consecration was on March 25, we need to consider the years that did not complete a full year. The year 1924 would not be counted as a full year because the ordination was in December and the consecration was in March. Therefore, we subtract one year from the 30-year difference, resulting in 29 full years.

","The first crewed flight was on April 12, 1981, and the last flight was on July 21, 2011. To find the number of months between these two dates, we can calculate the difference in years and then convert the years to months.

From April 1981 to April 2011 is 30 years, and from April 2011 to July 2011 is an additional 3 months. To convert the 30 years to months, we multiply by 12 (months per year): 30 years * 12 months/year = 360 months. Adding the additional 3 months gives us a total of 360 + 3 = 363 months.

","Theo Bot was Ambassador to Austria from 17 January 1968 to 1 July 1973. To calculate the number of months, we need to find the difference between these two dates and then convert the years and days into months.

From 17 January 1968 to 17 January 1973 is 5 years. Since 1968 was a leap year, we have 4 years with 12 months each and 1 year with 13 months (1968). So, 4 years * 12 months/year + 1 year * 13 months/year = 48 + 13 = 61 months.

From 17 January 1973 to 1 July 1973 is 5 months and 15 days. Since we are only asked for the number of months, we can round this to 5 months.

Adding the two periods together: 61 months + 5 months = 66 months.

","The 14 On Fire tour started on 21 February 2014 and ended on 22 November 2014. The next tour, 50 & Counting, started in 2012-13, which is before 2014. Since 50 & Counting started before 14 On Fire, it is not possible to calculate the number of years after 14 On Fire that 50 & Counting occurred. Therefore, the next tour after 14 On Fire did not occur in a subsequent year; it was the previous tour.
Final Answer: The next tour, 50 & Counting, occurred before 14 On Fire, so it is not possible to calculate the number of years after 14 On Fire that 50 & Counting occurred."

","The Cheltenham Spa station in Malvern Road was opened on 30 March 1908. To find out how many years ago it was opened, we need to calculate the difference between 1908 and the current year, which is 2022. Subtracting 1908 from 2022 gives us 114 years. However, since we are looking for the number of years ago, we need to subtract this number from 2022, which gives us 2022 - 114 = 1908. But since we are looking for the number of years ago from the current year, we should not subtract 1908 from 2022. Instead, we should simply state the number of years since the opening, which is 2022 - 1908 = 114 years ago.

","The orbiter's planned mission duration is 7.5 years, and its current elapsed duration is 2 years, 10 months. To find the difference, we need to convert the planned duration to months and then subtract the elapsed duration.

7.5 years = 7 years + 0.5 years = 84 months + 6 months = 90 months

Now, subtract the elapsed duration from the planned duration:

90 months (planned) - 2 years, 10 months (elapsed) = 90 months - 32 months = 58 months

To convert the difference back to years, we divide by 12:

58 months ÷ 12 = 4 years, 10 months

Final Answer: The orbiter's planned mission duration is 4 years, 10 months longer than its current elapsed duration."

","Richard Caswell served as the 1st Governor of North Carolina from November 12, 1776, to April 20, 1780, which is a total of 2 years and 5 months. He served as the 2nd Grand Master of the Masons of North Carolina from 1788 to 1789, which is a total of 1 year. To find out how many years longer his term as the 1st Governor was, we need to calculate the difference in years between the two terms. Since the terms are not exactly one year apart, we will only consider the full years for this calculation. Caswell's term as the 1st Governor was 2 years, and his term as the 2nd Grand Master was 1 year, so the difference is 2 - 1 = 1 year. However, since we are looking for the number of years longer, we need to consider the additional months. The difference in months is 5 months, which is less than a full year, so we cannot count it as a full year. Therefore, Caswell's term as the 1st Governor was 1 year longer than his term as the 2nd Grand Master of the Masons of North Carolina.

He was the 6th Minister of Law from 27 April 1951 to 3 April 1952, which is a total of 1 year and 10 days. To find out how many years longer he was in office as the 8th Minister of National Education than as the 6th Minister of Law, we subtract the duration of his term as the Minister of Law from the duration of his term as the Minister of National Education.

1 year and 1 month (8th Minister of National Education) - 1 year and 10 days (6th Minister of Law) = 1 month and 20 days

Since we are looking for the difference in years, we can convert the 1 month and 20 days into years. There are approximately 30 days in a month, so 1 month is roughly 1/12 of a year, and 20 days is roughly 20/30 or 2/3 of a month, which is 2/12 of a year.

","Alojzije Mišić was born on 10 November 1859. He was appointed as the Bishop of Mostar-Duvno and Apostolic Administrator of Trebinje-Mrkan on 29 April 1912. To find out how old he was at that time, we need to calculate the difference between the appointment date and his birth date. Since his birthday in November had not occurred yet in 1912, we subtract one year from his age.

1912 - 1859 = 53 years old

Since his birthday had not yet occurred in 1912, we subtract one year.

53 - 1 = 52 years old

Final Answer: Alojzije Mišić was 52 years old when he became the Bishop of Mostar-Duvno and Apostolic Administrator of Trebinje-Mrkan."

","Marina Alabau was born on 31 August 1985. The 2012 Olympic Games took place in London, and since the Olympics are held in the summer, we can assume that the 2012 Olympics occurred after her birthday in August. To find out her age during the 2012 Olympics, we subtract her birth year from the year of the Olympics: 2012 - 1985 = 27 years old. However, since her birthday in August had already passed by the time of the 2012 Olympics, she would have been 27 years old at the time.

To find out his age at the end of his last service, we calculate the difference between 1 August 1976 and his birthdate, 20 July 1911. Since he had not yet reached his birthday in 1976, we only count the years up to 1975, which is 1975 - 1911 = 64 years.

","The church was founded in the 13th century and was consecrated in 1949. To find out how old the church was when it initially closed, we need to calculate the difference between the year it was founded and the year it closed. Since the exact year of founding is not given, we will use the consecration year as a reference point, which is 1949. The church was closed in 1873. To find the age of the church at the time of closure, subtract the year of closure from the year of consecration: 1949 - 1873 = 76 years. However, since the church was founded in the 13th century, it would have been much older than 76 years at the time of its closure. The exact age cannot be determined without the specific founding year, but it would be at least 700 years old by 1873.
Final Answer: The church was at least 700 years old when it initially closed in 1873."

","The Valen Chapel was founded in the 13th century, and it was consecrated on 31 July 1949. To find out how old the church was at the time of consecration, we need to calculate the difference between the year 1949 and the 13th century. The 13th century spans from 1201 to 1300, so the church was founded sometime between 1201 and 1300. Since we don't have the exact year of founding, we can only estimate the age. If we take the midpoint of the 13th century, which is 1250, we can calculate the age as follows: 1949 - 1250 = 699 years. Therefore, the church was approximately 699 years old when it was consecrated.

","The planned duration of the Orbiter Mission was 7.5 years, and the elapsed time was 2 years, 10 months. To find the difference in years, we need to convert 10 months into years. There are 12 months in a year, so 10 months is approximately 10/12 or 0.83 years. Subtracting the elapsed time from the planned time gives us the difference: 7.5 years - 2.83 years = 4.67 years.

Backwoods Barbie Tour | (2008) | Better Day World Tour | (2011) | Blue Smoke World Tour | (2014)

","Dolly Parton had three tours listed: Backwoods Barbie Tour in 2008, Better Day World Tour in 2011, and Blue Smoke World Tour in 2014. To find the average length of time between the tours, we calculate the time between each tour and then find the average.

- From Backwoods Barbie Tour (2008) to Better Day World Tour (2011) is 3 years.
- From Better Day World Tour (2011) to Blue Smoke World Tour (2014) is 3 years.

Now, we add these two periods together: 3 years + 3 years = 6 years.

To find the average, we divide the total number of years by the number of periods: 6 years / 2 periods = 3 years.

","Stéphane Antiga won a silver medal in the CEV European Championship in 2003 in Germany and again in 2009 in Turkey. The question specifically asks for the year he won a silver medal in Moscow, which refers to the 2009 CEV European Championship held in Turkey, not Moscow. However, since the question might be interpreted as asking for the year he won a silver medal in a European Championship, the answer would be 2009.

","The Satish Dhawan Space Centre (SDSC) was named in 1982, as indicated by the ""Status: Active"" and ""First launch: 9 August 1979"" in the launch history, which implies that the center was active and operational from that date, and the name was likely given shortly after its establishment. However, the exact year of naming is not explicitly stated in the provided table, so we can only infer that it was named sometime after 1979, and before it became active in 1982. The table does not provide a direct answer to the year it was named, so we cannot give a precise year based on the given information. Final Answer: The year the Satish Dhawan Space Centre was named is not explicitly stated in the provided table."
