2. **Identify the Year of Marriage**: The table states that he married Adelheid Bendemann in 1868.

3. **Calculate the Age at Marriage**:
   - Subtract the year of birth from the year of marriage: 1868 - 1835 = 33.
   - Since he was born on October 31 and the marriage occurred in 1868, we need to check if he had already turned 33 by the time of the marriage in 1868.
   - If the marriage occurred after October 31, 1868, he would have been 33. If it occurred before October 31, he would have been 32.

4. **Conclusion**: Since the exact date of marriage in 1868 is not provided, we assume he was 33, as it is more likely he had already celebrated his birthday that year.

","To determine the age at which Johann Friedrich Wilhelm Adolf Baeyer won the Davy Medal, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Identify the Year of Birth:**
   - According to the table, Baeyer was born on October 31, 1835.

2. **Identify the Year He Won the Davy Medal:**
   - The table states that Baeyer won the Davy Medal in 1881.

3. **Calculate His Age in 1881:**
   - Subtract the year of birth from the year he won the medal:  
     \( 1881 - 1835 = 46 \).

4. **Check if He Had Already Had His Birthday in 1881:**
   - Since Baeyer was born on October 31 and the Davy Medal was awarded in 1881, we need to determine if he had already turned 46 by the time he received the medal.
   - If the medal was awarded before October 31, 1881, he would still be 45. If it was awarded on or after October 31, he would be 46.

","To determine the number of years the PBY Catalina was manufactured, we need to identify the start and end years of its production from the table.

1. **Identify the start year of production:**
   - The table states that the PBY Catalina was ""Produced 1936-1945."" This indicates that production began in 1936.

2. **Identify the end year of production:**
   - The table indicates that production ended in 1945.

3. **Calculate the duration of production:**
   - To find the number of years the PBY Catalina was manufactured, subtract the start year from the end year and add one (since both the start and end years are inclusive in the production period).
   - Calculation: \(1945 - 1936 + 1 = 10\)

Final Answer: The PBY Catalina was manufactured for 10 years."

","To determine how long Arnold Schwarzenegger served as the Governor of California, we need to look at the dates provided in the table for his term in office.

1. **Start Date**: November 17, 2003
2. **End Date**: January 3, 2011

Next, we calculate the duration between these two dates:

- From November 17, 2003, to November 17, 2010, is exactly 7 years.
- From November 17, 2010, to January 3, 2011, is an additional 1 month and 17 days.

Since we are asked for the duration in years, we can approximate the additional month and days as a fraction of a year. Typically, a month is considered as 1/12 of a year, and 17 days is approximately 17/365 of a year.

- 1 month ≈ 1/12 year ≈ 0.0833 years
- 17 days ≈ 17/365 year ≈ 0.0466 years

Adding these together gives approximately 0.1299 years.

Therefore, the total duration of Schwarzenegger's governorship is:

","To determine how long the Kalmar Union lasted, we need to identify the start and end years of the union and then calculate the duration between these two points in time.

1. **Identify the Inception Year:**
   - The table states that the Kalmar Union was inaugurated on 17 June 1397.

2. **Identify the End Year:**
   - The table mentions that the Kalmar Union effectively ended when Gustav Vasa was elected as King of Sweden in 1523. This marks the dissolution of the union as Sweden separated from the union.

3. **Calculate the Duration:**
   - Start Year: 1397
   - End Year: 1523
   - Duration = End Year - Start Year = 1523 - 1397 = 126 years

Thus, the Kalmar Union lasted for 126 years.

Final Answer: 126 years."

","To determine how long V/Line has been a corporation, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Identify the Date V/Line Became a Corporation:**
   - According to the table, V/Line became a corporation on 1 October 2003.

2. **Determine the Current Date:**
   - The current date is given as December 2022.

3. **Calculate the Duration:**
   - From 1 October 2003 to 1 October 2022 is exactly 19 years.
   - From 1 October 2022 to December 2022 is an additional 2 months.

4. **Convert the Duration to Years:**
   - Since we are calculating the duration in years, 2 months is approximately \( \frac{2}{12} = \frac{1}{6} \) of a year.

","To determine how long Yale University has been in existence, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Identify the Establishment Year**: According to the table, Yale University was established on October 9, 1701.

2. **Determine the Current Year**: The problem states that the current date is December 2022.

3. **Calculate the Number of Years**: Subtract the establishment year from the current year to find out how many years have passed since Yale was established.

   \[

","To determine how long Arnold Schwarzenegger served as the Governor of California, we need to look at the dates provided in the table for his term in office.

1. **Start Date**: November 17, 2003
2. **End Date**: January 3, 2011

Now, let's calculate the duration between these two dates:

- From November 17, 2003, to November 17, 2010, is exactly 7 years.
- From November 17, 2010, to January 3, 2011, is an additional 1 month and 17 days.

Since we are calculating the duration in years, we can approximate the additional month and days as a fraction of a year. Typically, a month is considered as 1/12 of a year, and 17 days is approximately 17/365 of a year.

- 1 month is approximately 1/12 = 0.0833 years.
- 17 days is approximately 17/365 = 0.0466 years.

Adding these together gives us approximately 0.1299 years.

Therefore, the total duration of his governorship is:

","To determine how many days after the groundbreaking on 11 July 1939 the construction of All Hallows Twickenham was completed, we need to identify the completion date of the construction. According to the table, the church was consecrated on 9 November 1940. The consecration typically marks the completion of the construction.

1. **Groundbreaking Date:** 11 July 1939
2. **Completion Date (Consecration):** 9 November 1940

Now, we calculate the number of days between these two dates:

- **From 11 July 1939 to 11 July 1940** is 1 year. Since 1940 is a leap year, this period includes 366 days.
- **From 11 July 1940 to 9 November 1940:**
  - July 11 to July 31: 20 days
  - August: 31 days
  - September: 30 days
  - October: 31 days
  - November 1 to November 9: 9 days

","To determine the number of days the Ethiopian Civil War lasted, we need to calculate the duration between the start and end dates provided in the table.

1. **Identify the Start and End Dates:**
   - Start Date: 12 September 1974
   - End Date: 28 May 1991

2. **Calculate the Duration:**
   - **From 12 September 1974 to 12 September 1990** is exactly 16 years.
   - **From 12 September 1990 to 12 September 1991** is 1 year.
   - **From 12 September 1991 to 28 May 1991** is actually a backward calculation, so we need to adjust:
     - From 12 September 1990 to 12 September 1991 is 1 year.
     - From 12 September 1991 to 28 May 1991 is 3 months and 15 days backward.

3. **Convert the Duration into Days:**
   - 16 years = 16 × 365 = 5,840 days

","To determine how many days longer the period between the aftershocks was compared to the period between the foreshocks, we need to calculate the number of days between each set of events and then compare them.

### Step 1: Calculate the period between the foreshocks

- **First foreshock:** 23 February 1960
- **Second foreshock:** 29 February 1960

The period between the foreshocks is from 23 February to 29 February.

- February 1960 is a leap year, so it has 29 days.
- Days between 23 February and 29 February: \(29 - 23 = 6\) days.

### Step 2: Calculate the period between the aftershocks

- **First aftershock:** 22 March 1960
- **Second aftershock:** 17 April 1960

The period between the aftershocks is from 22 March to 17 April.

- March has 31 days. From 22 March to 31 March: \(31 - 22 = 9\) days.
- From 1 April to 17 April: 17 days.

Total days between the aftershocks: \(9 + 17 = 26"

Casualties

","To determine how many months after the first foreshock the last aftershock occurred, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Identify the Date of the First Foreshock:**
   - The first foreshock occurred on 23 February 1960.

2. **Identify the Date of the Last Aftershock:**
   - The last aftershock occurred on 17 April 1960.

3. **Calculate the Time Difference:**
   - From 23 February 1960 to 23 March 1960 is 1 month.
   - From 23 March 1960 to 17 April 1960 is 23 days.

4. **Convert the Time Difference into Months:**
   - Since 23 days is less than a full month, the total time from the first foreshock to the last aftershock is 1 month and 23 days.

5. **Express the Time Difference in Months:**
   - 23 days is approximately 0.77 months (since 23/30 ≈ 0.77, assuming an average month length of 30 days).

6. **Add the Months:**
   - 1 month + 0.77 months = 1."

['Black rocket aircraft with stubby wings and short vertical stabilizers above and below tail unit', 'The X-15 pulling away from its drop launch plane']

","To determine the number of months between the introduction of the X-15 and its first flight, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Identify the Dates:**
   - First flight date: 8 June 1959
   - Introduction date: 17 September 1959

2. **Calculate the Time Difference:**
   - From 8 June 1959 to 8 September 1959 is exactly 3 months.
   - From 8 September 1959 to 17 September 1959 is an additional 9 days.

3. **Convert Days to Months:**
   - Since we are calculating in months, and 9 days is less than a full month, it does not add an additional month to the count.

4. **Total Months:**
   - The total time from the first flight to the introduction is 3 months and 9 days.

Since we are asked for the number of months, we consider only the full months.

Final Answer: 3 months."

","To determine how many months Theo Bot served as Ambassador to Austria, we need to look at the dates provided for his tenure in that position.

1. **Start Date**: 17 January 1968
2. **End Date**: 1 July 1973

Now, let's calculate the duration between these two dates:

- **From 17 January 1968 to 17 January 1973** is exactly 5 years.
- **From 17 January 1973 to 1 July 1973** is an additional 5 months and 14 days.

To convert the years into months:
- 5 years = 5 × 12 months = 60 months

Adding the additional months:
- 60 months + 5 months = 65 months

Therefore, Theo Bot served as Ambassador to Austria for a total of 65 months.

","To determine how many years after the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) was founded that its volume reached US$20.161 trillion, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Identify the founding year of the NYSE:**
   - The NYSE was founded on May 17, 1792.

2. **Identify the year when the volume was US$20.161 trillion:**
   - The table states that the volume was US$20.161 trillion in 2011.

3. **Calculate the number of years between the founding year and the year of the given volume:**

1. **Identify the Year of the XXXI Olympiad:**
   - The Games of the XXXI Olympiad took place in 2016. This is explicitly mentioned in the table under ""Dates: 9 August 2016 (heats & final).""

2. **Identify the Year of the Next Related Event:**
   - The table provides a sequence of events: ""← 2012 | 2016 | 2020 →"". This indicates that the next related event after 2016 was in 2020.

3. **Calculate the Number of Years Between the Two Events:**
   - Subtract the year of the XXXI Olympiad (2016) from the year of the next event (2020):
     \[
     2020 - 2016 = 4
     \]

Thus, the next related event occurred 4 years after the Men's 4 × 200 metre freestyle relay at the Games of the XXXI Olympiad.

","To determine how many years after the economic aid of $9.50 billion the revenues of the French economy reached 52.6% of GDP, we need to identify the years associated with each event:

1. **Economic Aid**: The economic aid of $9.50 billion is mentioned as occurring in 2016.

2. **Revenues as a Percentage of GDP**: The revenues reaching 52.6% of GDP is noted for the year 2019.

Now, we calculate the difference in years between these two events:

- Economic aid year: 2016
- Revenues year: 2019

The difference is:

\[ 2019 - 2016 = 3 \]

Therefore, the revenues of the French economy reached 52.6% of GDP 3 years after the economic aid of $9.50 billion.

","To determine how many years ago the Coordination Center for Ethnic Germans was founded, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Identify the founding year**: According to the table, the Coordination Center for Ethnic Germans was formed around 1937.

2. **Determine the current year**: The problem states that the current date is December 2022.

3. **Calculate the number of years since the founding**:
   - Subtract the founding year from the current year: 
     \[
     2022 - 1937 = 85
     \]

4. **Consider the month**: Since the current date is December 2022 and the exact month of founding in 1937 is not specified, we assume the founding occurred at some point in 1937. Therefore, by December 2022, it has been 85 years since the founding.

","To determine the number of years between England's first One Day International (ODI) and their first Twenty20 International (T20I), we need to identify the years in which these events occurred and then calculate the difference between them.

1. **Identify the year of England's first ODI:**
   - According to the table, England's first ODI was against Australia at the Melbourne Cricket Ground, Melbourne, on 5 January 1971.

2. **Identify the year of England's first T20I:**
   - The table states that England's first T20I was against Australia at the Ageas Bowl, Southampton, on 13 June 2005.

3. **Calculate the difference in years:**
   - Subtract the year of the first ODI from the year of the first T20I:  
     \( 2005 - 1971 = 34 \)

Therefore, there are 34 years between England's first ODI and their first T20I.

Final Answer: 34 years."

","To determine how many years Theo Bot served as Ambassador of the Netherlands to Austria, we need to look at the relevant information in the table:

1. **In office as Ambassador of the Netherlands to Austria**: 17 January 1968 - 1 July 1973

2. **Calculate the duration**:
   - Start date: 17 January 1968
   - End date: 1 July 1973

3. **Calculate the number of years**:

","To determine how many years it took for the Human Development Index (HDI) of France to grow by 0.089 points, we need to identify the relevant HDI values and their corresponding years from the table.

1. **Identify the HDI values and years:**
   - In 2020, the HDI of France was 0.909.
   - In 2019, the HDI of France was 0.820 (as indicated by the IHDI value for 2019).

2. **Calculate the change in HDI:**
   - The change in HDI from 2019 to 2020 is \(0.909 - 0.820 = 0.089\).

3. **Determine the number of years:**
   - The change occurred from 2019 to 2020, which is a period of 1 year.

Therefore, it took 1 year for the Human Development Index of France to grow by 0.089 points.

","To determine how many years longer Scottie Pippen played for the Chicago Bulls compared to the Portland Trail Blazers, we need to analyze his career history with each team:

1. **Chicago Bulls:**
   - First stint: 1987-1998
   - Second stint: 2003-2004

   To calculate the total years with the Bulls:

","To determine how many years longer the orbiter's planned mission duration is compared to its current elapsed duration, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Identify the Planned Mission Duration for the Orbiter:**
   - From the table, the planned mission duration for the orbiter is approximately 7.5 years.

2. **Identify the Elapsed Mission Duration for the Orbiter:**
   - The table states that the elapsed mission duration for the orbiter is 2 years and 10 months.

3. **Convert the Elapsed Duration to Years:**
   - 10 months is equivalent to \( \frac{10}{12} \) years, which simplifies to approximately 0.833 years.
   - Therefore, the elapsed duration in years is \( 2 + 0.833 = 2.833 \) years.

4. **Calculate the Difference Between Planned and Elapsed Durations:**
   - Subtract the elapsed duration from the planned duration: 
   \[
   7.5 \text{ years} - 2.833 \text{ years} = 4.667 \text{ years}

","To determine how many years passed between the groundbreaking and the opening of the Carrier Dome, we need to identify the dates for both events and calculate the difference between them.

1. **Identify the Groundbreaking Date:**
   - The table states that the groundbreaking occurred on November 11, 1978.

2. **Identify the Opening Date:**
   - The table states that the Carrier Dome opened on September 20, 1980.

3. **Calculate the Time Difference:**
   - From November 11, 1978, to November 11, 1979, is 1 year.
   - From November 11, 1979, to September 20, 1980, is 10 months and 9 days.

4. **Convert the Time Difference to Years:**
   - The total time from November 11, 1978, to September 20, 1980, is 1 year, 10 months, and 9 days.

Since we are asked for the number of years, we consider the full years only, which is 1 year, and the additional months and days do not complete another full year.

**Final Answer:** 1 year and 10 months (or approximately 1.83"

","To determine the number of years between the time Sam Snead began playing professionally and his death, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Identify the year Sam Snead turned professional:**
   - According to the table, Sam Snead turned professional in 1934.

2. **Identify the year of Sam Snead's death:**
   - The table states that Sam Snead died on May 23, 2002.

","To determine how many years Mohammad-Ali Foroughi was a member of the Parliament of Iran, we need to look at the dates provided for his tenure in the table.

1. **Start Date**: 19 November 1909
2. **End Date**: 3 August 1921

Now, let's calculate the duration between these two dates:

- **From 19 November 1909 to 19 November 1920** is exactly 11 years.
- **From 19 November 1920 to 3 August 1921** is an additional 8 months and 15 days.

To express this duration in years, we convert the additional months and days into a fraction of a year:

- 8 months is approximately \( \frac{8}{12} = \frac{2}{3} \) of a year.
- 15 days is approximately \( \frac{15}{365} \approx 0.041 \) of a year.

Adding these together gives:

\[ 11 + \frac{2}{3} + 0.041 \approx 11.675 \]

Rounding to two decimal places, Foroughi was a member of the Parliament for approximately 11.68 years.

","To determine the number of years between the establishment of the first ceasefire and the eruption of a wider conflict, we need to identify the relevant dates from the table:

1. **First Ceasefire Establishment**: The table states that the first ceasefire was established in September 2011.

2. **Eruption of a Wider Conflict**: The table mentions that a wider conflict erupted in 2016.

Now, let's calculate the number of years between these two events:

- The ceasefire was established in September 2011.
- The wider conflict erupted in 2016.

To find the number of years between September 2011 and 2016, we calculate:

- From September 2011 to September 2012 is 1 year.
- From September 2012 to September 2013 is another year, making it 2 years.
- From September 2013 to September 2014 is another year, making it 3 years.
- From September 2014 to September 2015 is another year, making it 4 years.
- From September 2015 to September 2016 is another year, making it 5 years.

Since the wider conflict erupted sometime in 2016, and we are considering the time from September 2011"

","To determine the number of years between the first edition of ""Atlantis"" and the 30th anniversary edition, we can follow these steps:

1. **Identify the Year of the First Edition:**
   - According to the table, the first edition of ""Atlantis"" was published in 1984.

2. **Identify the Year of the 30th Anniversary Edition:**
   - The table states that the 30th anniversary edition was published in 2019.

3. **Calculate the Number of Years Between the Two Editions:**

","To determine Novak Djokovic's age when he competed in the Olympic Games, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Identify the Year of the Olympic Games:**
   - According to the table, Djokovic won a bronze medal in the singles event at the 2008 Beijing Olympics.

2. **Determine Djokovic's Birth Year:**
   - The table states that Djokovic was born on 22 May 1987.

3. **Calculate Djokovic's Age in 2008:**
   - The 2008 Olympics took place in August 2008.

1. **Identify the Birth and Death Dates:**
   - Birth Date: April 7, 1908

","To determine how old Pierre Auguste Cot was when he painted ""The Storm,"" we need to follow these steps:

1. **Identify the Year ""The Storm"" was Painted:**
   - According to the table, ""The Storm"" was painted in 1880.

2. **Identify Pierre Auguste Cot's Birth Year:**
   - The table states that Pierre Auguste Cot was born on February 17, 1837.

3. **Calculate His Age in 1880:**
   - Subtract the birth year from the year the painting was completed:  
     \( 1880 - 1837 = 43 \).

4. **Determine if He Had His Birthday in 1880 Before Painting:**
   - Since ""The Storm"" was completed in 1880 and his birthday is on February 17, he would have already turned 43 by the time he painted it, assuming it was completed after February 17, 1880.

Therefore, Pierre Auguste Cot was 43 years old when he painted ""The Storm.""

1. **Identify Stephen Hawking's Birth Date:**
   - From the table, Stephen Hawking was born on 8 January 1942.

2. **Identify the Year of His First Marriage:**
   - The table states that he married his first wife, Jane Wilde, in 1965.

3. **Calculate His Age in 1965:**

     \( 1965 - 1942 = 23 \).

4. **Check if He Had Already Had His Birthday in 1965:**
   - Since his birthday is on 8 January and he married in 1965, we need to check if the marriage occurred before or after his birthday that year.
   - The table does not specify the exact date of marriage in 1965, but since it is common to assume the marriage occurred after his birthday unless stated otherwise, we will assume he had already turned 23 by the time of the marriage.

","To determine Stéphane Antiga's age when he won the FIVB World Championship, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Identify the Year of the FIVB World Championship Win:**
   - According to the table, Stéphane Antiga won the FIVB World Championship in 2014.

2. **Determine Stéphane Antiga's Birth Year:**
   - The table states that Stéphane Antiga was born on 3 February 1976.

3. **Calculate His Age in 2014:**
   - Subtract the birth year from the year of the championship:

     2014 - 1976 = 38
     \]

4. **Check if He Had His Birthday in 2014 Before the Championship:**
   - Since the championship was in 2014 and his birthday is on 3 February, he would have already turned 38 by the time of the championship.

Therefore, Stéphane Antiga was 38 years old when he won the FIVB World Championship.

   - Subtract the year she began skating from her birth year: 1985 - 1980 = 5.
   - Since she was born on 1 August 1980, and she began skating in 1985, we need to consider whether she had already had her birthday in 1985 by the time she started skating.
   - If she began skating before 1 August 1985, she would still be 4 years old. If she began after 1 August 1985, she would be 5 years old.

4. **Conclusion:**
   - The table does not specify the exact date in 1985 when she began skating, but it is reasonable to assume she began at some point in the year. Therefore, she was either 4 or "

","To determine how old Adolf von Baeyer was when he won the Nobel Prize, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Identify the Year of the Nobel Prize**: According to the table, Adolf von Baeyer won the Nobel Prize for Chemistry in 1905.

2. **Identify His Birth Year**: The table states that Adolf von Baeyer was born on October 31, 1835.

3. **Calculate His Age in 1905**:
   - Subtract the birth year from the year he won the Nobel Prize:  
     \( 1905 - 1835 = 70 \).

4. **Determine if He Had His Birthday in 1905 Before Winning the Prize**:
   - Since he was born on October 31 and the Nobel Prize is typically awarded in December, he would have already turned 70 by the time he received the prize in 1905.

Therefore, Adolf von Baeyer was 70 years old when he won the Nobel Prize.

Final Answer: 70 years old."

Since	1 October 2021 | ; 8 months ago |  ( | 1 October 2021 | )

","To determine how many years a judge can serve before a five-year extension is required, we need to consider the following information from the table:

1. **Judge Term Length**: Judges serve until they reach the age of 75. At that age, the President and the Senate can keep the judges for an additional term of five years, following the same process established for the appointment. This five-year extension can be repeated indefinitely.

2. **Initial Appointment Age**: The judge is appointed at the age of 50.

Now, let's calculate the number of years the judge can serve before reaching the age of 75:

- **Starting Age**: 50 years
- **Age at which extension is required**: 75 years

The number of years the judge can serve before reaching 75 is:

\[ 75 - 50 = 25 \text{ years} \]

Therefore, a judge appointed at the age of 50 can serve for 25 years before a five-year extension is required.

","To determine the difference in years between the planned and elapsed time of the Chandrayaan-2 Orbiter mission duration, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Identify the Planned Mission Duration for the Orbiter:**
   - The planned mission duration for the orbiter is given as approximately 7.5 years.

2. **Identify the Elapsed Mission Duration for the Orbiter:**
   - The elapsed mission duration for the orbiter is given as 2 years and 10 months.

3. **Convert the Elapsed Mission Duration to Years:**
   - 10 months is equivalent to \(\frac{10}{12}\) years, which simplifies to approximately 0.833 years.
   - Therefore, the elapsed mission duration in years is \(2 + 0.833 = 2.833\) years.

4. **Calculate the Difference in Years:**
   - Subtract the elapsed mission duration from the planned mission duration:
   \[
   7.5 \text{ years (planned)} - 2.833 \text{ years (elapsed)} = 4.667 \text{ years}

","To determine how many years after its first flight the Space Shuttle's first crewed flight occurred, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Identify the date of the first flight:**
   - The first flight of the Space Shuttle was ALT-12, which took place on August 12, 1977.

2. **Identify the date of the first crewed flight:**
   - The first crewed flight was STS-1, which took place on April 12, 1981.

3. **Calculate the time difference between the two dates:**
   - From August 12, 1977, to August 12, 1980, is 3 years.
   - From August 12, 1980, to April 12, 1981, is an additional 8 months.

4. **Convert the time difference into years:**
   - 8 months is approximately 8/12 of a year, which is 2/3 of a year or approximately 0.67 years.

5. **Add the years and the fractional year:**

","To determine Melissa Coates' age when she debuted at the IFBB Jan Tana Classic, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Identify the Year of Debut**: According to the table, Melissa Coates made her professional bodybuilding debut at the IFBB Jan Tana Classic in 1996.

2. **Identify Melissa Coates' Birth Year**: The table states that Melissa Coates was born on June 18, 1971.

4. **Conclude the Last Show Date**: Since the tour ended on December 1, 2011, and considering the distribution of shows, it is logical to conclude that the last show took place on this date, likely in Australia, as it is the last region listed.

Final Answer: The last show of the Better Day World Tour was on December 1, 2011"

Backwoods Barbie Tour | (2008) | Better Day World Tour | (2011) | Blue Smoke World Tour | (2014)

","To determine the average length of time between Dolly Parton's tours, we need to calculate the time intervals between each consecutive tour and then find the average of these intervals.

1. **Identify the Tours and Their Years:**
   - Backwoods Barbie Tour: 2008
   - Better Day World Tour: 2011
   - Blue Smoke World Tour: 2014

2. **Calculate the Time Intervals Between Tours:**
   - Interval between Backwoods Barbie Tour (2008) and Better Day World Tour (2011):
     \[
     2011 - 2008 = 3 \text{ years}
     \]
   - Interval between Better Day World Tour (2011) and Blue Smoke World Tour (2014):
     \[
     2014 - 2011 = 3 \text{ years}
     \]

3. **Calculate the Average Length of Time Between Tours:**
   - There are two intervals: 3 years and 3 years.
   - Average interval:
     \[
     \frac{3 + 3}{2} = \frac{6}{2} = 3 \text{ years}

","To determine the time difference in years between the first and last launch at site 200/39, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Identify the Dates of the First and Last Launches:**
   - The first launch at site 200/39 occurred on 20 February 1980.
   - The last launch at site 200/39 occurred on 13 December 2021.

2. **Calculate the Time Difference:**

","To determine the difference in days between the planned and elapsed time of the Vikram Lander mission duration, we need to analyze the information provided in the table.

1. **Identify the Planned Duration for Vikram Lander:**
   - The table states that the planned mission duration for the Vikram lander was ""≤ 14 days.""

2. **Identify the Elapsed Duration for Vikram Lander:**
   - The table indicates that the elapsed mission duration for the Vikram lander was ""0 days"" due to a landing failure.

3. **Calculate the Difference:**
   - The planned duration was up to 14 days, but since the lander failed to land, the elapsed duration was 0 days.
   - Therefore, the difference in days between the planned and elapsed duration is 14 days (since 14 days - 0 days = 14 days).

Final Answer: 14 days."

","To determine the span in years between Ryan Hunter-Reay's first and last win on the IndyCar circuit, we need to identify the years of his first and last IndyCar wins and then calculate the difference between these years.

1. **Identify the year of the first IndyCar win:**
   - According to the table, Ryan Hunter-Reay's first IndyCar win was at the 2008 Camping World Indy Grand Prix at the Glen.

2. **Identify the year of the last IndyCar win:**
   - The table states that his last IndyCar win was at the 2018 GoPro Grand Prix of Sonoma.

3. **Calculate the span in years:**
   - The first win was in 2008, and the last win was in 2018.
   - To find the span, subtract the year of the first win from the year of the last win:  
     \( 2018 - 2008 = 10 \)

Therefore, the span in years between his first and last win on the IndyCar circuit is 10 years.

Final Answer: 10 years."

['Faith at work in 1949 | Faith at work in 1949']

Background information

Died	February 9, 1976 | (1976-02-09) |  (aged 67) | Encino, California, U.S.

","To determine Percy Faith's age while at work in 1949, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Identify Birth Year**: Percy Faith was born on April 7, 1908.

2. **Determine the Year in Question**: We are interested in the year 1949.

3. **Calculate Age in 1949**:
   - Subtract the birth year from the year in question: \(1949 - 1908 = 41\).

4. **Consider the Birth Date**: Since we are considering the year 1949 and Percy Faith was born on April 7, we need to check if he had already celebrated his birthday by the time he was ""at work"" in 1949.
   - If he was at work at any point after April 7, 1949, he would have turned 41.
   - If he was at work before April 7, 1949, he would still be 40.

Since the question does not specify a date in 1949, we assume he was at work at some point during the year. Therefore, he would have turned 41 on April 7, 1949.

**Final Answer:** Percy Faith was 41 years old while at work in"
