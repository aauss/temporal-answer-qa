","To serve in the Australian Defence Force, one must be at least 17 years old. To be deployed, one must be at least 18 years old. Since the question asks for the age at which an Australian can both serve and be deployed, we need to find the age that satisfies both conditions. 
The age that satisfies both conditions is 18 years old, because at 18 years old, one can both serve (since 18 is greater than 17) and be deployed (since 18 is greater than or equal to 18).

['Gaston 2004-08-29 0710Z.jpg | Hurricane Gaston shortly after moving ashore on August 29', '(Extratropical after September 1)']

Part of the | 2004 Atlantic hurricane season

","To find out how many days Hurricane Gaston was over the water, we need to determine when it formed and when it made landfall. 

Hurricane Gaston formed on August 27, 2004. The table mentions that Gaston moved ashore on August 29, which implies that it made landfall on August 29. 

Therefore, Gaston was over the water from August 27 to August 29. This is a total of 2 days (August 27 and August 28, since it made landfall on the 29th).

However, it is also mentioned that Gaston became extratropical after September 1. This means that Gaston was still a cyclone (although not a hurricane) over land from August 29 to September 1, and then it became extratropical. 

But the question asks for the number of days Gaston was over the water as a hurricane or cyclone in general. Since Gaston formed on August 27 and moved ashore on August 29, and then became extratropical after September 1, we can infer that Gaston was over the water from August 27 to August 29, which is 3 days if we include the morning of the 29th before"

","To find the duration of the 2002 Atlantic hurricane season in months, we need to calculate the time between the first system formed (July 14, 2002) and the last system dissipated (October 16, 2002).

July to October is 3 months (not including the months of formation and dissipation), but since the season started in the middle of July and ended in the middle of October, we can approximate it to be roughly 3 months.

However, to be more precise, we can count the months: 
- The season started in July, so that's 1 month (partial).
- Then August (full month).
- Then September (full month).
- Then October (partial month).

So, the total duration is approximately 3-4 months, but since it started in mid-July and ended in mid-October, the duration can be considered as roughly 3 months.

","To find the duration of the 2005 Atlantic hurricane season in months, first determine the start and end dates. The first system formed on June 8, 2005, and the last system dissipated on January 6, 2006. 

June to December is 6 months, and since January 6, 2006, is approximately in the first week of January, we can approximate this as an additional 1 month (the remainder of the season after December), but more precisely, it is about 1/4 of a month into the new year (January), given the 6th is early in the month. However, calculating the full months from June to December gives 6 months, and then adding the fraction of the month in January gives a bit more than 6 months but less than 7. 

More precisely, from June 8 to December 31 is approximately 6.5 months (since June is half over when the season starts), and then from January 1 to January 6 is about 0.2 months (6 days out of approximately 30 days in January, which is 6/30 = 0.2).

","The 2022 celebration ended at nightfall on 17 March. The 2023 celebration began at sunset on 6 March. To find the number of days between these two dates, first find the number of days from 17 March 2022 to 31 December 2022, then add the number of days from 1 January 2023 to 6 March 2023.
From 17 March to 31 December, there are 289 days (31-17=14 days in March, 31 days in April, 30 days in May, 31 days in June, 31 days in July, 31 days in August, 30 days in September, 31 days in October, 30 days in November, and 31 days in December).
From 1 January to 6 March, there are 65 days (31 days in January, 28 days in February, and 6 days in March).
So, from 17 March 2022 to 6 March 2023, there are 289+65=354 days.

December has 31 days, November has 30 days (since the date is the 7th, we consider the remaining days in November which is 30-7+1 = 24 days, but for simplicity, we can calculate the days from November 7 to the end of the year as follows: the rest of November which is 24 days, December which is 31 days), so 24+31 = 55 days.

","To find out how many days later Mardi Gras started in 2022 compared to 2021, we need to calculate the difference between the two dates. 

Mardi Gras in 2021 was on February 16, and in 2022 it was on March 1. 

February has 28 days, so from February 16 to February 28, there are 12 days. 
Then, from February 28 to March 1, there is 1 more day (since February only has 28 days), for a total of 12 + 1 = 13 days, 
but since the date in 2021 was the 16th and not the 1st, we need to add the days from the 1st to the 16th to the 13 days, which is 15 days (16 - 1 = 15). 
However, the correct way to calculate this is to find the total number of days from February 16, 2021 to March 1, 2022, which can be calculated by finding the days from February 16, 2021, to February 28, 2021 (12 days), then the days in the months from March 2021 to"

","To find the difference in days between the start of Yom Kippur in 2021 and 2022, we need to calculate the number of days between September 15, 2021, and October 4, 2022.

October 2022 has 4 days from October 1 to October 4.

There are 31 days in October, 30 days in November, 31 days in December, 31 days in January, 28 days in February, 31 days in March, 30 days in April, 31 days in May, 30 days in June, 31 days in July, and 31 days in August, for a total of 365 days in 2022, not accounting for the 15 days in September 2021 and the 4 days in October 2022.

Then, find the difference in months from July to July, which is 0 months, since they are the same month in different years, but then add 12 months for the 1 year difference: 0 + 12 = 12 months, but then subtract the months from the start of the year to July in 1758 and add the months from the start of the year to July in 1759. There are 7 months from January to July in 1758 and 7 months from January to July in 1759, but these cancel each other out, since 7 - 7 = 0, so we don't need to add or subtract any months. So the total difference in months is 12.

Since both celebrations occurred in March, they are in the same month but different years. The difference between the years is 2024 - 2022 = 2 years. There are 12 months in a year. Multiply the years by 12 to get the total months: 2 * 12 = 24 months.

Next, find the months from the start of the year to the current month (December): 12 months (for the entire year) - 3 months (from January to October, the 10th month, but 3 months from October to December, the 12th month, are subtracted from 12, since we want the months from the beginning of the year to October) = 9 months, but since we want the months from October to December, 12 - 10 + 1 = 3. However, since the months from the start of the year to the current month should be subtracted, the months from the start of the year to October should be added to the years in months, so 384 months + 9 months = 393 months.

","The Federal Defence Forces of Germany was founded on November 12, 1955. The current year is 2022, and the month is December. To calculate how many months ago the Federal Defence Forces of Germany was founded, first calculate the number of years: 2022 - 1955 = 67 years. Then, calculate the number of months from the years: 67 * 12 = 804 months. November is 1 month before December, so subtract 1 month from 804: 804 - 1 = 803 months, but also consider the month in 1955, November, and the current month in 2022, December. Since November is before December, the correct calculation is: 804 - 1 = 803 months.

","The table does not indicate that HMS Montrose was launched in 2005. According to the table, HMS Montrose was launched on 31 July 1992 and commissioned on 2 June 1994. 

To find the number of months between these two dates, first find the number of months between July 1992 and June 1994. There are 12 months in a year. From 1992 to 1994 is 2 years. 2 years * 12 months/year = 24 months. 

Then, account for the months: July to December is 6 months (the remaining months of 1992), and January to June is 6 months (the months of 1994 before the commissioning). 

So, 24 months - 6 months - 6 months = 12 months, but this calculation does not account for the month of the launch (July) and the month of the commissioning (June). Since the launch was in July and the commissioning was in June of the next year after the full 2-year period, the actual time between launch and commissioning is almost 2 years (23 months, from July 1992 to June 1994, but since it is from July to June"

In the first year (2020), there are 10 months from February to October (since January has already passed)  and in the second year (2021) there are 10 months from January to October, for a total of 10+10 = 20 months,  but since we started counting from February of the first year we must add the month of January of the first year and also the month of October of the second year was a partial month, so we must add 1 for January and subtract 1 for the partial month of October for a total of 20 +1 -1 = 20 months.

Then, from January 1992 to July 1992 is 7 months. Adding all these months together: 1 + 24 + 7 = 32 months.
Final Answer: 32 months"

","The mission duration was planned for 7 years. The elapsed time is 6 years, 3 months, and 18 days. To find the remaining time, subtract the elapsed time from the planned time. 
First, convert the planned time to months: 7 years * 12 months/year = 84 months.
Then, convert the elapsed time to months: 6 years * 12 months/year = 72 months, and add the 3 months: 72 + 3 = 75 months.
Now, subtract the elapsed time from the planned time: 84 - 75 = 9 months.

","To find the difference between the Western and Eastern Easter dates in 2024 and 2022, we first need to find the difference in days for each year.

In 2024, the Western Easter date is March 31, and the Eastern Easter date is May 5. To find the difference, we can count the days from March 31 to May 5, which is 35 days.

In 2022, the Western Easter date is April 17, and the Eastern Easter date is April 24. The difference is 7 days.

Now, to find how many more days there were between the Western and Eastern Easter dates in 2024 compared to 2022, we subtract the difference in 2022 from the difference in 2024: 35 - 7 = 28.

","Kimi Räikkönen competed in the Formula One World Championship from 2001 to 2009 and then again from 2012 to 2021. To find the total years he competed in Formula One, we need to add the years from the two separate periods: 
2009 - 2001 + 1 = 9 years
2021 - 2012 + 1 = 10 years
9 + 10 = 19 years (in Formula One)

He also competed in the World Rally Championship from 2009 to 2011, which is 3 years (2011 - 2009 + 1 = 3 years) but this overlaps with the end of his first period in Formula One. 

So the total years he competed is 19 (in Formula One) + the non-overlapping years in the World Rally Championship. Since 2009 is the only overlapping year, the non-overlapping years are 2010 and 2011 (2 years). 
19 (in Formula One) + 2 (non-overlapping in World Rally Championship) = 21 years (of competition).

However, another way to look at this is to consider all the years from 2001 to 2021 and subtract any"

","HMS Somerset was laid down on 12 October 1992, and it was launched on 25 June 1994. To find out how many years after being laid down it launched, we need to calculate the difference between these two dates. 

1994 - 1992 = 2 years.

However, since it was laid down in October and launched in June, it is actually less than 2 years, approximately 1 year and 8 months. But if we are only considering the year, it is 2 years after being laid down that the ship was still in the process of being built and had not yet launched, and it launched in the year after that, so approximately 1 year and 8 months after being laid down, or nearly 2 years, the ship launched, but since the launch occurred before the 2-year mark from October, it launched about 1 year and 8 months after being laid down.
 
Since the question is asking ""How many years after being laid down did HMS Somerset launch?"" we should round down to the nearest whole year since launch occurred before the 2-year mark from October.

","The party was refounded as Adal on 5 November 2020, and it was dissolved on 26 April 2022. To find the number of years between these two dates, first find the difference in years: 2022 - 2020 = 2. Then, consider the months: November to April is 5 months (since November is the 11th month and April is the 4th month, 11 - 4 = 7, but this is more than half a year, so it is actually the next year minus 1, or 12 - 7 = 5). Since 5 months is less than half a year (6 months), the party was dissolved approximately 1 year after being refounded.

","The Malayan Emergency began on June 16, 1948. Clement Attlee was a leader until 1951. To find out how many years after the Malayan Emergency began that Attlee became a leader, we need to find out when Attlee became a leader. Since Attlee was a leader until 1951, he must have become a leader before 1951. 

Clement Attlee was the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom from 1945 to 1951, so he was already a leader when the Malayan Emergency began in 1948. Therefore, he did not become a leader after the Malayan Emergency began, but rather he was already a leader when it began.

However, if we consider the question as asking how many years Attlee was a leader after the Malayan Emergency began, we can calculate the time period from 1948 to 1951. 
1951 - 1948 = 3 years.

Final Answer: 0 years (since he was already a leader)"

","Viv Richards made his ODI debut on 7 June 1975. To find out how many years ago this was, we need to subtract 1975 from the current year, which is 2022 (assuming the current year is 2022, since the current date was given as December 2022). 

2022 - 1975 = 47

Jenson Button's Formula One World Championship career spanned from 2000 to 2017, which is 17 years. 

His Super GT GT500 Championship career started in 2017. Since the table does not provide information on when he stopped racing in the Super GT GT500 Championship, we can only confirm that he raced in this championship in 2017 and 2018 (the year he won the championship).

Combining both careers, Jenson Button has been racing from at least 2000 to 2018, which is 18 years. However, since we do not have information on whether he stopped racing after 2018, we cannot give an exact number of years. But based on the information provided, he has raced for at least 18 years.

","To find the total number of years Pau Quemada played in the senior division, we can look at the ""Senior career"" section of the table and calculate the total duration. 

From 0000 to 2005 is an unknown duration, but we know he played from 2005 to 2006 (1 year), from 2006 to 2009 (3 years), from 2009 to 2011 (2 years), from 2011 to 2016 (5 years), from 2016 to 2021 (5 years), and from 2021 to the present (the end year is not specified, so we will assume the current year is 2022 for calculation purposes, which is 1 year).

However, since the start year of his senior career is not specified, we can only calculate the duration from 2005 onwards: 1 + 3 + 2 + 5 + 5 + 1 = 17 years.

Additionally, we know he played for the national team from 2003 to 2021, which is 18 years. Since his senior career must have started before 2005 and he was already playing for the national team in 2003, it is reasonable to assume"

","To determine how many years Sachin Tendulkar played for the national side, we need to look at the years of his Test debut and his last Test or ODI, whichever is more recent. Tendulkar's Test debut was on 15 November 1989, and his last Test was on 14 November 2013. His last ODI was on 18 March 2012. Since the last Test (2013) is more recent than the last ODI (2012), we use the years of the Test debut (1989) and the last Test (2013) to calculate the number of years he played.

","The party was founded in 2010, but it has a historical and modern founding date. The modern founding date is August 2021, but to determine how many years it took from the founding of the party until it was formally registered, we should use the historical founding date of 2010. The party was registered on 18 August 2016. To find the number of years between these two dates, subtract the founding year from the registration year: 2016-2010=6.

","To find the number of years it took to build HMS Somerset, we need to look at the dates when the ship was laid down and when it was launched, and then also consider when it was commissioned, as the building process includes these stages. 

HMS Somerset was laid down on 12 October 1992 and launched on 25 June 1994. This means it took approximately 1 year and 8 months from being laid down to being launched. 

However, the ship was not commissioned until 20 September 1996, which is about 2 years after it was launched. 

So, in total, from being laid down to being commissioned, it took HMS Somerset approximately 4 years to be built.

","The table does not mention HMS Astute. It mentions HMS Somerset, which was commissioned on 20 September 1996. To find out how many years HMS Somerset has been in service, we need to subtract the commission year from the current year. However, since the current year is not specified in the question, we will assume it is 2022 (given the context of the problem). 
2022 - 1996 = 26 years.

","The Arab Socialist Ba'ath Party was founded on 7 April 1947. The Ba'ath Brigades, the paramilitary wing, existed from 2012 to 2018, which is 6 years. To find out how long the party existed before the paramilitary wing was formed, subtract the start year of the paramilitary wing from the founding year of the party: 2012 - 1947 = 65 years. Since the paramilitary wing existed for 6 years, the party has existed for 65 + 6 = 71 years longer than the paramilitary wing, but since we are looking for how many years longer the party has existed than the paramilitary wing, we just need to subtract the length of time the paramilitary wing existed from the time the party existed before the paramilitary wing was formed and the time the party existed while the paramilitary wing existed. 
However, a simpler way to solve this is to subtract the end year of the paramilitary wing from the founding year of the party: 2018 - 1947 = 71 years. Then subtract the length of time the paramilitary wing existed: 71 - 6 = 65 years.

","To determine the number of years one must wait from the earliest they can serve to being eligible for special forces, we need to find the difference between the age for special forces deployment and the age to serve. 

The age to serve is 17 years, and the age for special forces deployment is 19 years. 

19 - 17 = 2 years.

Now, we subtract the synodic period from the orbital period: 60,195 - 367.49 = 59,827.51.

Rounded to the nearest integer, this is 59,828 days.

","Pau Quemada played for Club Egara from an unspecified start year to 2005 and then again from 2016 to 2021. The total number of years he played for Club Egara is the sum of the years in the two periods. Since the start year for Club Egara is unspecified, it is only possible to determine the minimum number of years he played for Club Egara, which is the number of years from 2005 minus the start year plus the number of years from 2016 to 2021. The number of years from 2005 minus the start year is at least 5 years (2005-2000), and the number of years from 2016 to 2021 is 5 years. Therefore, the minimum number of years he played for Club Egara is at least 5+5=10 years. 

He played for Laren from 2005 to 2006, which is 1 year. 

The difference between the minimum number of years he played for Club Egara and the number of years he played for Laren is 10-1=9 years.

","Räikkönen was active in Formula One from 2001 to 2009 and then from 2012 to 2021. This means he was active for 9 years (2001-2009) and then for another 10 years (2012-2021) for a total of 9+10=19 years. However, there is a gap between 2009 and 2012 when he was not active, so the years should not be added directly; instead, calculate the years from 2001 to 2021: 2021-2001=20. Then subtract the gap years from 2009 to 2012, which is 2012-2009=3 years. Therefore, the total years Räikkönen was active in Formula One is 20-3=17, but since he was active in 2009 and 2012, it is actually 20-2=18, but then 1 year is added back for being active in 2009 and 2012; thus 18+1=19, but then 2 years are subtracted for the years 2009 and 2012 being counted twice, which results in 19-2=17 years"

","Ali Farag was born on April 22, 1992. He won his first team gold at the World Team Championships in 2017, in Marseille. To find his age at that time, subtract his birth year from the year he won the gold: 2017 - 1992 = 25. However, since his birthday is in April and the World Team Championships took place at an unspecified date, we can't determine the exact age. If the championships took place before April 22, 2017, he was 24 years old. If they took place after April 22, 2017, he was 25 years old.

","To find Bradman's age during his Test debut, we need to calculate the difference between his birth year and the year of his Test debut. Bradman was born on 27 August 1908, and his Test debut was on 30 November 1928. 

Since his birthday (August 27) had already passed in 1928, we can simply subtract the birth year from the year of the Test debut: 1928 - 1908 = 20.

Therefore, Bradman was 20 years old during his Test debut.

","Dhyan Chand was born on August 29, 1905. The 1936 Olympic Games took place in Berlin. Since the exact dates of the 1936 Olympic Games are not provided, we can assume the games occurred around the same time as the opening ceremony, which took place on August 1, 1936. 

If Dhyan Chand won his gold medal before his birthday in 1936, he would have been 30 years old. If he won his gold medal after his birthday in 1936, he would have been 31 years old. 

Given that the opening ceremony took place on August 1, 1936, which is before Dhyan Chand's birthday (August 29), it is likely that Dhyan Chand won his gold medal before his birthday. 

Therefore, Dhyan Chand was 30 years old when he won his final gold medal at the 1936 Olympic Games.

","Dhyan Chand was born on 29 August 1905. The 1928 Olympics took place in Amsterdam. To find Dhyan Chand's age at the 1928 Olympics, we need to subtract his birth year from 1928 and then consider the month of the Olympics. The 1928 Amsterdam Olympics took place from May 17 to August 12, 1928. Since Dhyan Chand's birthday is on August 29, his birthday had not occurred yet in 1928 when the Olympics took place. 
1928 - 1905 = 23 years old. However, since his birthday is in August and the Olympics took place before his birthday, he was still 22 years old.

","Fernando Alonso won the Spanish Grand Prix in 2013. He was born on July 29, 1981. To find Alonso's age in 2013, subtract his birth year from the year he won: 2013 - 1981 = 32. Since Alonso's birthday is on July 29, he would have been 31 years old when the Grand Prix took place, because it occurs before his birthday.

","Francesco Moser rode for Sanson from 1976 to 1980. To find the age of Moser during this time period, we need to subtract his birth year from the years he rode for Sanson. Moser was born on June 19, 1951. 

In 1976, Moser was 25 years old (1976-1951=25). 
In 1977, Moser was 26 years old (1977-1951=26). 
In 1978, Moser was 27 years old (1978-1951=27). 
In 1979, Moser was 28 years old (1979-1951=28). 
In 1980, Moser was 29 years old (1980-1951=29).

Since the question is asking for Moser's age when he rode for Sanson, and the years he rode for Sanson are 1976-1980, the answer would be the range of ages he was during this time, which is 25-29 years old.

Jorge Lombi was born in 1971, and the event took place in 1995. 
1995 - 1971 = 24
Since his birthday is on November 1, and the Pan American Games took place in Mar del Plata (the exact date is not specified), we can assume that the event occurred before or after his birthday. However, without knowing the exact date of the event, we can only give the age range. 
If the event occurred before November 1, 1995, he was 23 years old. If it occurred on or after November 1, 1995, he was 24 years old.

","To find out how old Pollock was during his Test debut, we need to calculate the difference between his birth year and the year of his Test debut. 

Pollock was born on 16 July 1973, and his Test debut was on 16 November 1995. 

Since his birthday (July 16) is before his Test debut (November 16) in the same year, we can simply subtract the birth year from the Test debut year: 1995 - 1973 = 22.

So, Pollock was 22 years old during his Test debut.

","The table does not explicitly state that Sebastian Vettel won the United States Grand Prix. However, it does state that his first entry was the 2007 United States Grand Prix and his first win was the 2008 Italian Grand Prix. 

Since Vettel's first win was in 2008, we can determine his age at that time. Vettel was born on July 3, 1987. The 2008 Italian Grand Prix took place on September 14, 2008. Therefore, Vettel was 21 years old when he won his first Grand Prix.

However, the question asks about the United States Grand Prix. The table does not provide information about Vettel winning the United States Grand Prix. It only mentions that his first entry was the 2007 United States Grand Prix. 

To determine Vettel's age during the 2007 United States Grand Prix, we need to know the date of the event. The 2007 United States Grand Prix took place on June 17, 2007. Vettel was born on July 3, 1987, so he was 19 years old during the 2007 United States Grand Prix.

","The table states that the Australian Defence Force's annual exports totaled around A$2 billion in 2018. However, it also states that the active personnel were 59,095 as of 30 June 2020. Since these two values are from different years, we need to find a year when both conditions are met, but the table does not provide such a year. 
However, the question can be answered by saying that there is no year in the table where both conditions are met. The active personnel were 59,095 in 2020, and the annual exports were around A$2 billion in 2018.
Final Answer: 2018 is the year for exports, but active personnel were different; 2020 is the year for active personnel, but exports were different."

","To determine the year in which Hanukkah occurs latest in the year, we need to examine the provided dates for 2021, 2022, 2023, and 2024. 

- In 2021, Hanukkah ends on December 6.
- In 2022, Hanukkah ends on December 26.
- In 2023, Hanukkah ends on December 15.
- In 2024, Hanukkah ends on January 2, which is in the next year but starts on December 25.

The latest Hanukkah occurs in the year is in 2022, when it ends on December 26, and in 2024, when it starts on December 25 and ends in the next year. However, considering the start and end dates within a calendar year, 2024 has the latest start date, but since the question seems to focus on when Hanukkah ""occurs latest in the year"" within the Gregorian calendar's framework, we look for the latest end date within a year, which would be December 26 in 2022.

","To find out how many days the 1995 Atlantic hurricane season lasted, we need to find the difference between the last system dissipation date and the first system formation date. 

The first system formed on June 2, 1995, and the last system dissipated on November 1, 1995. 

June has 30 days, so from June 2 to June 30, there are 28 days. 
July has 31 days, August has 31 days, September has 30 days, and October has 31 days. 
So from July 1 to October 31, there are 31 + 31 + 30 + 31 = 123 days. 
Adding the 28 days from June, we get 28 + 123 = 151 days. 
Then, adding the 1 day from November 1, we get 151 + 1 = 152 days. 

Therefore, the 1995 Atlantic hurricane season lasted for 152 days (from June 2 to November 1) but also including the remainder of the year after November 1 is not necessary as November 1 is the last day, and we are counting the days the season lasted, not the days after it ended.

","To determine how many days the 2005 Atlantic hurricane season lasted, we need to calculate the difference between the last system dissipated date (January 6, 2006) and the first system formed date (June 8, 2005).

June has 30 days, July has 31 days, August has 31 days, September has 30 days, October has 31 days, November has 30 days, and December has 31 days. So from June 8, 2005, to December 31, 2005, is 206 days (30-8=22 days in June + 31 days in July + 31 days in August + 30 days in September + 31 days in October + 30 days in November + 31 days in December). 
Then, from January 1, 2006, to January 6, 2006, is 6 days.

","Yom Kippur starts at sunset and ends at nightfall the following day. This means it takes place over a period of 2 days, but since the second day is only nightfall, the actual observance and festivities occur on 1 day and the evening before and the evening after.
However, considering the start and end times, it can be said that Yom Kippur takes place over 2 calendar days (1 day and 1 evening/night, and the next evening/night), but the actual celebration and observance happen in approximately a 25-26 hour period, or 1 day and the evenings before and after.
But in a more straightforward sense, the answer would be that Yom Kippur is observed for the entirety of 1 day (from the evening before, through the day, until the evening of the next day), but considering the phrasing of the question, a more literal answer is more suitable.

","Iraq was an ally of Fatah - The Revolutionary Council from 1974-1978 and 1991-2002. To calculate the total number of years, we need to calculate the years for each period separately and then add them together. 

The first period was from 1974-1978, which is 1978-1974 = 4 years.

The second period was from 1991-2002, which is 2002-1991 = 11 years.

Adding the years from both periods, we get 4 + 11 = 15 years.
Final Answer: 15 years"

","To find the difference in synodic period between Mars and Earth, we first need to determine the synodic period of each planet. 

The synodic period of Mars is given as 779.96 days, which can be converted to years by dividing by 365.25 (the average number of days in a year): 779.96 days / 365.25 days/year = 2.1354 years.

The synodic period of Earth is essentially the same as its orbital period, which is 1 year.

Now, we can find the difference in synodic period between Mars and Earth: 2.1354 years - 1 year = 1.1354 years.

Final Answer: 1.1354 years"
