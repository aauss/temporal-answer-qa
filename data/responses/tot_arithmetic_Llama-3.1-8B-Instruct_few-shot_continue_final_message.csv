- 31 (Dec) + 31 (Nov) + 30 (Oct) + 31 (Sep) + 30 (Aug) + 31 (Jul) + 31 (Jun) + 30 (May) + 31 (Apr) + 28 (Mar) + 29 (Feb) + 31 (Jan) = 341 days. We need 99 days from here. So we go back to December 31, 2016.
- December 31, 2016 - 31 = December 31, 2016 - 31 days = November 30, 2016
- November 30, 2016 - 30 = November 30, 2016 - 30 days = October 31, 2016

We first add 28 days to May 26, 2012, then 30 days to June 25, 2012, then 31 days to July 26, 2012, then 31 days to August 26, 2012, then 31 days to September 26, 2012, then 30 days to October 26, 2012, then 31 days to November 26, 2012, then 30 days to December 26, 2012, then 31 days to January 26, 2013, then 28 days to February 23, 2013, then 31 days to March 26, 2013, then 30 days to April 25, 2013, then 31 days to May 26, 2013.

To find the date 856 days from now, we need to add 856 days to 2004-05-28. Since there are 365 days in a year, we can divide 856 by 365 to get 2 years and a remainder of 156 days.

However, we can also use a simpler method by dividing 78 by 7 and taking the remainder. The quotient will give us the number of weeks and the remainder will give us the number of days left. 78 / 7 = 11 remainder 1. This means that 78 days is equivalent to 11 weeks and 1 day. Now, we add 11 weeks to 1998-02-05. Adding 11 weeks to 1998-02-05 gives us 1998-04-02. Finally, we add 1 day to this date to get the final answer: 1998-04-03"", ""answer"": ""1998-04-03""}"

First, we need to find the difference in years between the two dates. Chris was born in 2007, and Hannah was born in 2006. The difference is 1 year. Since Chris was 838 days old, we need to find the number of days in a year. There are 365 days in a year, so we can divide 838 by 365: 838 // 365 = 2 with a remainder. This means Chris was 2 years old and had 838 - (365 * 2) = 108 days left. Since Hannah is 1 year younger than Chris, she was 2 years old as well. The number of days left for Hannah is 108 days. Now we need to add 108 days to Hannah's birth date: 2006-12-28 + 108 days = 2007-03-15.

We find the number of full years between both dates. Each year has 365 days. There are 7 full years until 2009, which are 7 * 365 = 2555 days. Then, we find the number of days from 2010-01-01 to 2010-08-28: 229 days. Then we add the number of days in 2010 from January 1 to December 30: 334 days. Finally, we add all these together: 1 + 2555 + 229 + 334 = 3019 days. The number of days from December 30, 2002 to December 30, 2009 are 365 * 7 + 1 = 2561 days. Thus, the number of days from December 30, 2009 to August 28, 2010 is 3019 - 2561 = 458 days. Therefore, Theodore's age is 2561 + 458 = 3019 days."", ""age"": 3019}"

- The third assignment: 18 * 3600 + 47 * 60 + 59 = 67519 seconds

Now, we need to find the total time taken: 2354 + 32646 + 67519 = 104819 seconds.

To find the total time in hours, minutes and seconds, we divide by 3600 for hours, the remainder by 60 for minutes, and the remainder by 60 for seconds: 
- 104819 // 3600 = 29 hours with a remainder of 179 seconds
- 179 // 60 = 2 minutes with a remainder of 59 seconds

Since the character starts studying at 02 AM, we add the total time to the start time: 
- 02 AM + 29 hours = 07 PM

We do this by subtracting the start time from the end time. The difference is 7 hours and 39 minutes. However, this is not the final answer because the end time is before the start time, so we need to add 24 hours to the end time. This is equivalent to subtracting the start time from the end time on the next day. The difference is 20 hours and 39 minutes. Now we need to convert the difference into seconds to make it easier to calculate the total difference. We do this by multiplying the hours by 3600 and the minutes by 60, then adding the seconds. 20 * 3600 + 39 * 60 + 54 = 72000 + 2340 + 54 = 74394 seconds. Now we need to convert the answer back to the required format. We need to divide 74394 by 3600 with a remainder: 74394 // 3600 = 20 hours. The remainder is 74394 - (20 * 3600) = 74394 - 72000 = 2394. Now we need to divide 2394 by 60 with a remainder: 2394 // 60 = 39 minutes. The remainder is 2394 - (39 * 60) = 2394 - 2340 = 54 seconds.

First, we calculate the number of years between 1769 and 1940: 1940 - 1769 = 171 years.
Since his birthday is on 22 September, we need to subtract the number of days from 22 September to 24 February in the year of his birth (1769), and in each year until 1940.
There are 22 days in September 1769. 
There are 365 days in each year until 1940, except for leap years.
There are 366 days in leap years.
Leap years occur every 4 years.
So, we need to subtract 22 days from 1940, and then subtract the number of days in the years that are not leap years, and the number of days in the leap years.
We can do this by subtracting 365 * 49 (49 non-leap years) + 366 * 10 (10 leap years) + 22 from 1940.
This equals 1940 - (365 * 49 + 366 * 10 + 22) = 1940 - 17895 = 45.
Thus, the mythological character's birthday has passed 45 days ago in the year 1940.
Therefore, the mythological character's age is 171 years."", ""answer"": 171}"

First, we calculate the number of years between both dates. There are 22 years. Then we need to calculate the number of days between June 25 and March 28. We can do this by counting the days from June 25 to December 31, which is 182 days, and then add the days from January 1 to March 28, which is 57 days. So the total number of days is 182 + 57 = 239 days. There are 365 days in a year, so 239 days is 0 years and 239 days. To convert this to years, we need to divide the remainder by 365: 239 // 365 = 0 years and 239 % 365 = 239 days. Therefore, the character is 22 years and 239 days old. Since the answer should be in years, we need to add the years and the remainder of the days to 365: 22 + 239 // 365 = 22 + 0 = 22 years and 239 % 365 = 239 days is approximately 0.657 years. Thus the character is 22 + 0.657 = 22.657 years old. Since the problem does not specify if the character can be a fraction of a year old, we will round it to 23 years."", ""answer"": 23}"
