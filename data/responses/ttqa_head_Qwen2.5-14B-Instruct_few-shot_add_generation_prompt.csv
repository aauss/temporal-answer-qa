","Jeffrey Epstein was apprehended on July 6, 2019, and he died on August 10, 2019. To find out how many months passed, we calculate the difference between these dates.

From July 6 to July 31 is 25 days in July.
Then, from August 1 to August 10 is 10 days in August.

In total, there are 25 + 10 = 35 days.
Since there are approximately 30 days in a month, 35 days is roughly equivalent to 1 month and a few extra days.

Final Answer: Approximately 1 month"

Now let's calculate his age when he got married:
1. Calculate the difference between the marriage year and birth year: 1877 - 1852 = 25.
2. Since his birthday is on December 19, if they got married before his birthday in 1877, he would be 24. However, since the exact date of marriage isn't specified and it's likely close to his birthday or after, we can reasonably assume he was 25.

","To determine the age at which Melissa L. Coates retired from wrestling, we need to use her birth year and her retirement year.

1. From the ""Born"" row, we can see that Melissa L. Coates was born on June 18, 1971.
2. According to the ""Retired"" row, she retired in 2020.

Now we calculate her age when she retired:

- She was born in 1971 and retired in 2020, so the difference is 2020 - 1971 = 49 years.
- Since she retired in 2020 but had not yet celebrated her 50th birthday (which would be on June 18), she was 49 years old at the time of retirement.

","To determine the age at which Paul Gauguin married Mette-Sophie Gad, we need to calculate his age based on his birth date and the year of marriage.

1. **Birth Date**: Eugene Henri Paul Gauguin was born on June 7, 1848.
2. **Marriage Year**: He married Mette-Sophie Gad in 1873.

Now, let's calculate his age in 1873:

- From 1848 to 1873 is a span of 1873 - 1848 = 25 years.

Since his birthday is on June 7, and assuming they got married sometime after that date in 1873, he would have turned 25 during the year 1873.

Therefore, Paul Gauguin was 25 years old when he married Mette-Sophie Gad.

","To find out at what age Pierre Auguste Cot died, we need to calculate the difference between his death year and birth year.

From the table:
- Died: 2 August 1883
- Born: 17 February 1837

Subtract the birth year from the death year: 1883 - 1837 = 46 years.

However, to be precise, we should consider the dates within those years. Since his birthday (17 February) comes after his death date (2 August), he would have had his 47th birthday shortly after his death.

Therefore, Cot died at the age of 46 but just before turning 47.

","To find out the age at which Stephen Hawking divorced Jane Wilde, we need to follow these steps:

1. Identify the birth date of Stephen Hawking: 8 January 1942.
2. Identify the date when he divorced Jane Wilde: 1995.
3. Calculate his age at the time of the divorce.

First, calculate the difference in years:
1995 - 1942 = 53 years.

Since the divorce happened in 1995 and his birthday was in January, and assuming the divorce occurred before his birthday, he would have turned 53 during that year. However, since the exact date of the divorce isn't specified, it's most accurate to say he was 53 years old, having already celebrated his birthday in that year.

","Libya supported different sides at different times during the Ethiopian Civil War:

1. From 1977 to 1985, Libya supported the rebels.
2. From 1985 to 1991, Libya supported the Derg regime.

To find out the total duration of Libyan support, we need to add up these periods:

From 1977 to 1985 is 8 years.
From 1985 to 1991 is 6 years.

Adding these together gives us the total duration of Libyan support:
8 + 6 = 14 years.

We can break down the period into months and count the days accordingly:
- From 19 April 2021 to 30 April 2021: 11 days (since 30 April - 19 April = 11 days)
- Full month of May 2021: 31 days

Deployment date: 3 April 2021
Last flight date: 11 June 2022

From April 3, 2021, to April 3, 2022, is exactly one year. 
From April 3, 2022, to June 11, 2022, is 2 months and 8 days.

Adding these periods together gives us a total of 1 year, 2 months, and 8 days. Since we are asked for the duration in months, we convert the full year into months (1 year = 12 months) and add the remaining months:

1 year = 12 months
+ 2 months
+ 8 days ≈ 0.26 months (since there are approximately 30.44 days in a month)

Total = 12 + 2 + 0.26 = 14.26 months

Since we typically round to the nearest whole number for such durations, we can say it took about 14 months.

Travelled	7.17 km (4.46 mi) on Mars as of 11 June 2022 | [update]

","To find out how long it was between Ingenuity's first flight and its last flight in months, we need to calculate the difference in days and then convert it to months.

1. First flight date: April 19, 2021
   Last flight date: June 11, 2022

2. Calculate the difference in days:
   - From April 19, 2021, to April 19, 2022, is exactly one year.
   - From April 19, 2022, to June 11, 2022, is 53 days (30 days in May + 11 days in June).

3. Total days between the two dates:
   One year = 365 days
   Adding the extra 53 days gives us 365 + 53 = 418 days.

4. Convert days to months:
   - An average month is approximately 30.44 days (365 days / 12 months).
   - Therefore, 418 days / 30.44 days/month ≈ 13.73 months.

Rounding to the nearest whole month gives us approximately 14 months.

Place	Rome, Italy

","Alojzije Mišić was installed as the Bishop of Mostar-Duvno on 14 July 1912 and his term ended on 26 March 1942. 

To calculate the duration of his service, we need to find the difference between these two dates:

1. Start Date: 14 July 1912
2. End Date: 26 March 1942

First, let's calculate the years between 1912 and 1942:
1942 - 1912 = 30 years

Next, we need to account for the months and days within those years. From July 1912 to March 1942 spans almost 29 full years, plus the remaining period from July 1941 to March 1942.

To be precise:
- Full years served: 1913 to 1941 inclusive, which totals 29 years.
- Partial year: From July 1941 to March 1942 is less than a full year but still counts towards the total service time.

Thus, the total service time is 29 years plus the partial year from July 1941 to March 1942, which can be considered as nearly one full year.

Therefore, the total duration is approximately 30 years.

Denomination	Catholic

Coat of arms	Ambrose Rayappan's coat of arms

","To calculate how long Ambrose Rayappan served as Archbishop Emeritus of Pondicherry and Cuddalore from 1953, we need to identify when his term as Archbishop ended and use that to infer when he became Archbishop Emeritus. 

From the table, we see that his term as Archbishop ended on 17 March 1973. Since the title ""Archbishop Emeritus"" typically denotes retired archbishops, it is reasonable to assume he became Archbishop Emeritus shortly after his term ended.

However, the specific date of becoming Archbishop Emeritus isn't provided directly. Given no other information, we can reasonably assume he held this title until his death on 24 November 1999.

Therefore, the duration of his service as Archbishop Emeritus can be calculated as follows:
- From 17 March 1973 to 24 November 1999.

To find the number of years:
1. Calculate the difference between 1999 and 1973: 1999 - 1973 = 26 years.
2. Verify if there is any partial year involved:
   - From 17 March 1973 to 24 November 1999 spans parts of both 1973 and 1999, but does not exceed a full additional year since both dates fall within their respective years.

Thus, the total period is approximately 26 years.

Now, let's count the years:

From 1908 to 1921 is 13 years. However, since his debut was in mid-1908 and his last appearance was in mid-1921, we need to consider that he didn't play a full season in 1908 and 1921.

Therefore, the total duration spans from part of 1908 to part of 1921, which is effectively 12 full seasons plus parts of the first and last year.

1. From 3 November 1863 to 8 June 1953 spans a period of 89 years.

To confirm the exact duration:
- From 1863 to 1952 is 89 years minus one year because the full year of 1953 must be counted separately.
- Adding the months and days: From 3 November 1952 to 8 June 1953 is approximately 7 months and 5 days.

Since we are asked for the duration in years, we can round this to the nearest whole year. Thus, the duration is essentially 89 years.

Final Answer: 89 years"

How long in years did Miloš Obrenović I's reign last in which Karađorđe was his successor?,2,emperor,765,<num_years>,years,head,"category

['MilosObrenovic 1848.jpg']

Prince of Serbia
Reign	6 November 1817 - 25 June 1839
Predecessor	Himself (As Grand Vožd of Serbia)
Successor	Milan II

Grand Vožd of Serbia
Reign	23 April 1815 - 6 November 1817
Predecessor	Karađorđe
Successor	Himself (as Prince of Serbia)
Died	26 September 1860 (aged 77 or 80) | Belgrade, Serbia, Ottoman Empire
Burial	St. Mark's Church, Belgrade, Serbia
Consort	Ljubica Vukomanović
Issue	Princess Petria | Princess Elisabeth | Prince Milan Obrenovic II | Prince Michael Obrenovic III | Princess Maria | Prince Todor | Prince Gabriel
House	Obrenović
Father	Teodor Mihailović
Mother	Višnja Urošević
Religion	Serbian Orthodox

","Firstly, it's important to note that Karađorđe was Miloš Obrenović I's predecessor when he became the Grand Vožd of Serbia, not his successor. However, we can still calculate how long Miloš Obrenović I's reign lasted starting from when Karađorđe was the predecessor.

From the table:
- Miloš Obrenović I's reign as Grand Vožd of Serbia started on 23 April 1815.
- His reign as Prince of Serbia began on 6 November 1817, following his term as Grand Vožd.
- His reign ended on 25 June 1839.

To find out how long his reign lasted, we need to sum up both periods of his reign:
1. Grand Vožd of Serbia: 23 April 1815 to 6 November 1817.
2. Prince of Serbia: 6 November 1817 to 25 June 1839.

Calculating the total duration:
- From 23 April 1815 to 6 November 1817 is 2 years, 6 months, and 15 days.
- From 6 November 1817 to 25 June 1839 is 11 years, 7 months, and 20 days.

Adding these together:
2 years + 11 years = 13 years
6 months + 7 months = 13 months (which is 1 year and 1 month)
15 days + 20 days = 35 days (which is 1 month and 5 days)

Combining all parts:
13 years + 1 year + 1 month + 1 month + 5 days = 14 years, 2 months, and 5 days

For simplicity in answering the question about years:
- We can round this to 14 years, considering the additional months and days do not complete another full year.

1. Roy turned pro in 1968 but had been playing on the amateur tour since 1953.
2. His retirement year is mentioned as 1983.

So, the total duration of his career from 1953 to 1983 can be calculated as follows:

","To determine how long AT&T had been known by a different name, we need to look at its history before it became AT&T Inc.

From the information given:
- AT&T Inc. was founded on October 5, 1983.
- Before becoming AT&T Inc., it was known as Southwestern Bell Corporation from 1983 to 1995 and then as SBC Communications Inc. from 1995 to 2005.

This means AT&T Inc. was formed directly from SBC Communications Inc., which itself came from Southwestern Bell Corporation. Therefore, AT&T Inc. was not known by any other name after 2005 when it changed its name to AT&T Inc.

So, we need to calculate the time period from the formation of AT&T Inc. to 2005:
- From 2005 to 2022 (current year): 2022 - 2005 = 17 years.
- But the question asks about the time before 2005 when it was known by a different name.

Thus, we consider the periods:
- Southwestern Bell Corporation (1983-1995): 12 years
- SBC Communications Inc. (1995-2005): 10 years

Adding these up gives us:
12 years + 10 years = 22 years

['Part of the Central American crisis and Cold War', 'Clockwise: Guerrilla camp in Morazán in 1983; Salvadoran Armed Forces soldiers; Ronald Reagan and José Napoleón Duarte in 1985; The final offensive of 1981; Guerrillas in Perquín, Morazán in 1990. | Clockwise: Guerrilla camp in Morazán in 1983; Salvadoran Armed Forces soldiers; Ronald Reagan and José Napoleón Duarte in 1985; The final offensive of 1981; Guerrillas in Perquín, Morazán in 1990.']

Casualties and losses
['7,000 killed | 20,000 killed', '70,000-80,000 killed | (in total) | 8,000 disappeared | 550,000 internally displaced | 500,000 refugees in other countries']

","To determine how long the Salvadoran Civil War had been going on when North Korea withdrew, we need to consider the following information:

1. The conflict lasted from 15 October 1979 to 16 January 1992.
2. North Korea provided diplomatic support until 1990.

First, calculate the duration of the civil war up to 1990:
- Start date: 15 October 1979
- End date for North Korean support: 1990

From October 1979 to October 1990 is exactly 11 years. Since North Korea withdrew at some point during 1990, the conflict had been ongoing for slightly less than 11 years but more than 10 years.

","To determine how long the church has been open in total, we need to account for its periods of closure and operation.

1. **Identify the periods of operation:**
   - The church was consecrated on 31 July 1949.
   - It was closed from 1873 to 1949.

2. **Calculate the time it was closed:**
   - Closed period: 1873 to 1949 = 76 years.

3. **Calculate the time it was open before being closed:**
   - Founded in the 13th century.
   - Let’s assume it was built around the founding time and operated continuously until it was closed in 1873.
   - Time open before closure: 1873 - 13th century ≈ 1873 - 1200 = 673 years (approximating the 13th century to around 1200 AD).

4. **Calculate the time it was open after reopening:**
   - Reopened in 1949.
   - Current date is December 2022.
   - Time open since 1949: 2022 - 1949 = 73 years.

5. **Total time open:**
   - Total time open before closure: 673 years.
   - Total time open after reopening: 73 years.
   - Total time closed: 76 years.

Since the question asks about the total time the church has been open, we exclude the closure period:
\[ \text{Total time open} = 673 + 73 = 746 \text{ years} \]

","To determine how long the current AT&T logo has been in use, we need to identify the key date changes related to the company's rebranding or name changes, as these often coincide with logo changes.

From the table, we see that:
- The company was formerly known as Southwestern Bell Corporation from 1983 to 1995.
- From 1995 to 2005, it was known as SBC Communications Inc.
- In 2005, it changed its name to AT&T Inc., which is the current name.

Since there is no specific mention of when the current logo was introduced, we can infer that the current logo was likely implemented around the time the company adopted its current name, AT&T Inc., in 2005.

The current date is given as December 2022. Therefore, the duration the current logo has been in use is:

","To calculate how long Alojzije Mišić served as the Bishop of Mostar-Duvno and Apostolic Administrator of Trebinje-Mrkan, we need to determine the difference between his installation date and the end of his term.

Installation date: 14 July 1912
Term ended: 26 March 1942

First, let's compute the number of years directly:
From 1912 to 1942 is 30 years.

Now, we need to account for the exact months and days within those years:
- From July 14, 1912, to March 26, 1942, spans part of the first year (1912) and the last year (1942).

For 1912:
- July 14 to December 31 = 5 months and 17 days

For 1942:
- January 1 to March 26 = 2 months and 26 days

Adding these periods together gives us approximately 5 months and 17 days in 1912 plus 2 months and 26 days in 1942, totaling about 7 months and 43 days, which is slightly less than 8 months. This means that the full term includes parts of both the start and end years but does not add a complete extra year.

Thus, the total service period is essentially 30 years minus a small fraction of a year at each end, which we can approximate as nearly 30 full years.

","José Manuel de Herrera is listed under the Emperor section, not the Prime Minister section. However, the timeline provided shows the government structure changed over time. The Mexican Empire had a Prime Minister before it became a monarchy. According to the table, the Provisional Government Junta was in place until 1822, and then a Constituent Congress was established in 1822. After that, a National Institutional Junta took over from 1822 to 1823.

However, since José Manuel de Herrera is mentioned in relation to the Emperor period and there's no specific mention of his role as Prime Minister, we should focus on the Emperor's duration. The table indicates that José Manuel de Herrera served as Emperor from 1822-1823.

But the question asks about his tenure as Prime Minister. Since the table does not provide this information directly, and considering the context provided, José Manuel de Herrera wasn't a Prime Minister during the empire's timeframe but rather an emperor. Therefore, based on the given data, we can't determine how long he was Prime Minister.

Since the question seems to have a misinterpretation or missing detail regarding José Manuel de Herrera's role, we cannot accurately state the duration of his prime ministership. However, if we consider the context and the data provided, José Manuel de Herrera is noted as an emperor, not a prime minister, during the given period.

Final Answer: The table does not provide information on José Manuel de Herrera serving as Prime Minister; he is listed as an Emperor from 1822-1823."

","To calculate how long Mišić's term as bishop lasted, we need to subtract the date his term started from the date it ended.

Start date: 14 July 1912 (installed)
End date: 26 March 1942

From 14 July 1912 to 14 July 1942 is exactly 30 years. Since his term ended on 26 March 1942, which is before 14 July 1942, his term is slightly less than 30 full years.

We can break down the calculation as follows:
- From 14 July 1912 to 14 July 1942 is 30 years.
- Subtract the period from 14 July 1942 to 26 March 1942, which is about 8 months and 12 days.

Since 8 months and 12 days is a fraction of a year, we round down to the nearest whole number.

","Richard Caswell had two spouses mentioned in the table. His first marriage was to Mary Mackilwean, who he married in 1752 and died in 1757. This means he was married to her for 1757 - 1752 = 5 years. His second marriage was to Sarah Herritage, whom he married in 1758. However, no end date for this marriage is given in the table, so we can only determine the duration of his first marriage based on the information provided.

","To determine how long Valen Chapel was in operation after its completion, we need to find the dates of completion and closure, and then calculate the difference.

From the table:
- Completion: 1707
- Closed: 1873-1949 (meaning it closed in 1873 and reopened later)

Since the question asks about the period after initial completion, we use the closure date of 1873.

Now, we calculate the difference between the completion year and the closure year:
1873 - 1707 = 166 years

","To find out how many days after being laid down INS Trishul was launched, we need to calculate the difference between the dates when it was laid down and when it was launched.

- Laid down: 24 September 1999
- Launched: 24 November 2000

Step 1: Calculate the number of days from September 24, 1999, to November 24, 2000.

First, calculate the days remaining in September 1999 after the 24th:
September has 30 days, so there are 30 - 24 = 6 days left in September.

Next, add all the days in October 1999:
October has 31 days.

Then, add all the days in November 1999:
November has 30 days.

Finally, add the days from January 1, 2000, to November 24, 2000:
January: 31 days
February: 29 days (it’s a leap year)
March: 31 days
April: 30 days
May: 31 days
June: 30 days
July: 31 days
August: 31 days
September: 30 days
October: 31 days
November: 24 days

Summing these up:
6 (remaining days in September) + 31 (October) + 30 (November) + 31 (January) + 29 (February) + 31 (March) + 30 (April) + 31 (May) + 30 (June) + 31 (July) + 31 (August) + 30 (September) + 31 (October) + 24 (November) = 424 days.

Therefore, INS Trishul was launched 424 days after it was laid down.

July has 31 days.

August has 31 days.

From September 1 to September 17: 
17 days in September.

Adding these together:
22 (remaining days in June) + 31 (July) + 31 (August) + 17 (September) = 101 days.

","To find out how many days passed between the London premiere and the United States (New York City) premiere of ""49th Parallel"", we need to calculate the difference between October 8, 1941, and March 5, 1942.

From October 8, 1941, to October 31, 1941, there are 23 days remaining in October.
November has 30 days.
December has 31 days.
January has 31 days.
February has 28 days in 1942 (not a leap year).
March 1 - March 5, 1942, have 5 days.

Adding these together gives us:
23 + 30 + 31 + 31 + 28 + 5 = 148 days

Final Answer: 148 days"

","To find out how many days after the formation of the Belarusian People's Republic Belarus gained independence from Russia, we need to calculate the difference between the two dates.

The formation of the Belarusian People's Republic was on March 9, 1918.
Independence from Russia was gained on March 25, 1918.

First, calculate the difference within March:
March 25 - March 9 = 16 days

Since both events happened in the same month, there is no need to consider different months or years. Thus, the number of days between the two events is simply 16 days.

","To find out how many days after the groundbreaking on 11 July 1939 the construction of All Hallows Twickenham was completed, we need the completion date. However, the given information does not provide a specific completion date for the construction. We only have the consecration date, which is 9 November 1940. 

Since the question cannot be answered precisely without the exact completion date, we can infer that the church was likely completed around the time it was consecrated. Therefore, we will use the consecration date as an approximation for the completion date.

Step 1: Calculate the number of days from 11 July 1939 to 9 November 1940.

From 11 July 1939 to 31 December 1939: 
- July: 20 days (31 - 11 + 1)
- August: 31 days
- September: 30 days
- October: 31 days
- November: 30 days
- December: 31 days

Total for 1939 = 20 + 31 + 30 + 31 + 30 + 31 = 173 days

From 1 January 1940 to 9 November 1940:
- January: 31 days
- February: 29 days (leap year)
- March: 31 days
- April: 30 days
- May: 31 days
- June: 30 days
- July: 31 days
- August: 31 days
- September: 30 days
- October: 31 days
- November: 9 days

Total for 1940 up to 9 November = 31 + 29 + 31 + 30 + 31 + 30 + 31 + 31 + 30 + 31 + 9 = 324 days

Total days = 173 days + 324 days = 497 days

['~400,000-579,000 killed | ~1,200,000 deaths from famine']

","To calculate the total duration of the Ethiopian Civil War in days, we need to find the difference between the end date and the start date.

Start Date: 12 September 1974
End Date: 28 May 1991

First, let's break down the calculation into years and remaining days:
- From 12 September 1974 to 12 September 1991 is 16 years and 28 May to 12 September of the same year needs to be calculated separately.
- From 28 May to 12 September is 115 days (28 + 31 [June] + 31 [July] + 31 [August] + 12 [September] = 115).

So, the total period is 16 years and 115 days.

Now, convert years to days:
- Each common year has 365 days.
- Out of the 16 years, 4 are leap years (1976, 1980, 1984, 1988), adding 4 extra days.

Therefore, the total number of days is:
\[ 16 \times 365 + 4 + 115 = 5840 + 4 + 115 = 5959 \]

Final Answer: 5959 days"

Casualties
~ 12,000-15,000 dead | ~ 12,000 injured

","To find out how many days longer the period between the aftershocks was compared to the foreshocks, we need to calculate the duration of each period.

First, let's determine the duration of the foreshocks:
- The first foreshock occurred on 23 February 1960.
- The main shock occurred on 29 February 1960.
Duration of foreshocks = 29 February 1960 - 23 February 1960 = 6 days.

Next, let's determine the duration of the aftershocks:
- The first aftershock occurred on 22 March 1960.
- The second aftershock occurred on 17 April 1960.
Duration of aftershocks = 17 April 1960 - 22 March 1960.
Since March has 31 days, we can calculate this as:
From 22 March to 31 March = 10 days.
Adding the full month of April until 17 April = 17 days.
Total duration of aftershocks = 10 + 17 = 27 days.

Now, compare the durations:
Duration of aftershocks = 27 days
Duration of foreshocks = 6 days
Difference = Duration of aftershocks - Duration of foreshocks = 27 - 6 = 21 days.

Final Answer: The period between the aftershocks was 21 days longer than the period between the foreshocks."

Since we're asked for the number of months, we can say it's approximately 1 month plus a fraction, but typically when such questions ask for ""months,"" they seek the full month count. Thus, it's most accurate to state 1 month, acknowledging there were additional days beyond just one month.

However, if we strictly follow the typical interpretation where the full duration is considered, it would be rounding up to 2 months since it's more than half of a second month.

For precision in this context, the most fitting answer would be:
Final Answer: 1 month (with acknowledgment that it rounds up to 2 months considering the full duration)"

","To determine how many months passed between the launch and commissioning of INS Trishul, we need to calculate the difference between the dates given for these events.

- Launch Date: 24 November 2000
- Commissioning Date: 25 June 2003

First, let's find the difference in years:
From November 2000 to November 2003 is 3 years. 

Next, we account for the remaining months:
- From 24 November 2000 to 25 June 2003 includes the full period from November 2000 to June 2003.

Breaking it down:
- From November 2000 to June 2003 is 2 years and 7 months (since November to June is 7 months).

Now, convert this into months:
- 3 years = 3 * 12 = 36 months
- Adding the additional 7 months gives us 36 + 7 = 43 months.

Therefore, INS Trishul was officially commissioned 43 months after its launch.

","The New York City premiere of ""49th Parallel"" was on 5 March 1942, and its release to the rest of the United States was on 15 April 1942.

To find out how many months passed between these two dates, we calculate the difference between March 5 and April 15.

From March 5 to March 31 is 26 days.
From April 1 to April 15 is 15 days.

Adding these together gives us 41 days. Since there are approximately 30 days in a month, 41 days is roughly 1 month and 11 days.

However, since we're asked for the number of months, and typically such questions round to the nearest whole month, the answer would be considered 1 month.

- Full months in between: March (31 days), April (30 days), May (31 days), June (30 days), July (31 days), August (31 days), September (up to the 28th): 28 days

Adding up the days:
4 + 31 + 30 + 31 + 30 + 31 + 31 + 28 = 216 days

Now convert the total days into months:
- There are approximately 30.44 days per month (365/12).

So, the number of months is:
216 / 30.44 ≈ 7.1

Therefore, it took approximately 7 months for Mexican independence to occur after the Plan of Iguala.

","To determine how many months after the beginning of his reign as King of Burma Bayinnaung's coronation took place, we need to compare the dates of his reign start and his coronation.

1. Bayinnaung's reign as King of Burma started on **30 April 1550**.
2. His first coronation took place on **11 January 1551** at Toungoo.

Now let's calculate the difference in months between these two dates:

- From April 30, 1550, to January 11, 1551, there are 8 months and 11 days.

Breaking it down:
- From April 30, 1550, to January 11, 1551:
  - April 30 to April 30 (0 days)
  - May (31 days)
  - June (30 days)
  - July (31 days)
  - August (31 days)
  - September (30 days)
  - October (31 days)
  - November (30 days)
  - December (31 days)
  - January 1 to January 11 (11 days)

Adding up the full months:
- April to January inclusive gives us 9 months.
- Subtracting one month because the reign starts at the end of April and ends before the next April, we have 8 full months plus the partial months.

Therefore, the total is 8 months and 11 days.

Since we're asked for the number of months, we can approximate this to 9 months for simplicity, but the precise calculation is 8 months and 11 days.

","To find out how many months passed between the first crewed flight and the last flight, we need to calculate the difference between their respective dates.

First crewed flight: April 12, 1981
Last flight: July 21, 2011

Calculate the difference in years and months:
1. Difference in years: 2011 - 1981 = 30 years
2. Difference in months: July 21, 2011, to April 12, 1981
   - From April 12, 1981, to April 12, 2011, is exactly 30 years.
   - From April 12, 2011, to July 21, 2011, is 3 months and 9 days.

Adding this up gives us a total of 30 years and 3 months. Since the question asks specifically about months, we can convert the years into months:
- 30 years * 12 months/year = 360 months
- Adding the additional 3 months: 360 + 3 = 363 months

Therefore, 363 months passed between the first crewed flight and the last flight.

","To find out how many months after the first flight the X-15 was introduced, we need to calculate the time difference between June 8, 1959 (first flight) and September 17, 1959 (introduction).

From June 8 to June 30: 22 days
From July 1 to July 31: 31 days
From August 1 to August 31: 31 days
From September 1 to September 17: 17 days

Adding up these days: 22 + 31 + 31 + 17 = 101 days

To convert days into months, note that an approximate month is 30 days. So, 101 days / 30 ≈ 3.37 months.

Since we're asked for the number of months and typically would round down to the nearest whole month unless specified otherwise, we can say it took approximately 3 months.

However, given the precision of the dates, it is more accurate to state that it was introduced in the third month after the first flight.

First foreshock date: 23 February 1960
Last aftershock date: 17 April 1960

From 23 February to 31 March is 37 days (end of February).
Adding the days in April up to the 17th gives us 17 days.
So the total number of days between the first foreshock and the last aftershock is 37 + 17 = 54 days.

Now, convert 54 days into months. Since there are approximately 30 days in a month, 54 days is roughly 54/30 = 1.8 months.

Detained	11,286 detained currently, (per AAPP)

","To find out how many months after the start of the 2021 Myanmar protests the death toll reached 2,091, we need to follow these steps:

1. Identify the start date of the protests: 2 February 2021.
2. Determine the death toll given: 2,037 protesters.
3. Note that the death toll of 2,037 is mentioned as of 23 May 2021.
4. Since the question asks about 2,091 deaths, and no exact date for reaching 2,091 deaths is provided, we can use the closest known figure of 2,037 deaths on 23 May 2021 as a reference point.
5. Calculate the time elapsed from 2 February 2021 to 23 May 2021.

From February 2 to May 23:
- February: 28 days (since it's not a leap year) minus 2 days = 26 days
- March: 31 days
- April: 30 days
- May: 23 days

Total days = 26 + 31 + 30 + 23 = 110 days

Convert days to months:
110 days ≈ 3.61 months (as there are approximately 30.44 days in a month)

Since the question asks specifically about reaching 2,091 deaths and we only have data up to 2,037 deaths on 23 May 2021, we can conclude that 2,091 deaths would likely occur shortly after this period.

Final Answer: Approximately 3.61 months"

","To determine how many months after the start of the protests the death toll reached 47 police officers and 7 soldiers, we need to know the exact dates when this information was reported and when the protests began.

1. The protests began on 2 February 2021.
2. According to the table, the death toll of 47 police officers and 7 soldiers was reported by the State Administration Council (SAC) as of 23 May 2021.

Now let's calculate the duration:

- Start date: 2 February 2021
- End date: 23 May 2021

Counting the months:
- From 2 February to 31 March = 2 months (including February)
- April = 1 month
- May (up to 23rd) = part of the 4th month

Therefore, it took approximately 3 full months plus part of the fourth month.

- Since it's now December 2022, we need to account for the days beyond December 24, 2022, up until December 2022.
- From December 24, 2022, to December 2022: 6 days (assuming today is closer to the end of December)

However, since we are asked for the number of months and not days, we can simplify this to just the months.

So, from June 24, 2022, to December 2022 is 6 months.

","To determine how many months have passed since Max Aaron retired, we need to calculate the difference between the current date (December 2022) and his retirement date (April 19, 2018).

Step 1: Calculate the number of full years between April 19, 2018, and December 2022.
From April 19, 2018, to April 19, 2022, is exactly 4 years.

","The mission duration is stated as ""19 years and 1 month since launch"". Given the current date is December, 2022, we need to calculate how much time has passed since the launch date of June 2, 2003.

From June 2, 2003 to June 2, 2022 is exactly 19 years. Since it's currently December 2022, we have already surpassed the 19-year mark. So, the mission has been running for over 19 years and 6 months (from June 2 to December).

Since the mission duration is given relative to the launch date, and it's already exceeded the specified period, there are no months left in the ""19 years and 1 month"" duration as stated. However, if we interpret the question as asking about the ongoing mission time past its initial expected duration, we can't give a specific remaining time without knowing the projected end date or total intended lifespan beyond the initial 19 years and 1 month.

","To determine how many months people experienced the effects of the 1960 Agadir earthquake, we need to look at the timeline of significant events listed under foreshocks and aftershocks.

- Foreshocks occurred on 23 February (III intensity) and 29 February (VI intensity).
- Aftershocks occurred on 22 March (VI intensity) and 17 April (VI intensity).

The main earthquake happened on 29 February 1960. People would have felt the effects starting from the foreshock on 23 February, continuing through the main shock on 29 February, and lasting until the last aftershock on 17 April.

So, let's count the months:
- February (main shock and foreshock on 23rd)
- March (aftershock on 22nd)
- April (aftershock on 17th)

Therefore, the effects spanned across three months: February, March, and April.

['Black rocket aircraft with stubby wings and short vertical stabilizers above and below tail unit', 'The X-15 pulling away from its drop launch plane']

","To find out how many months separated the introduction of the X-15 from its first flight, we need to calculate the difference between the dates given for each event.

First flight: June 8, 1959
Introduction: September 17, 1959

From June 8 to June 30 is 22 days.
July has 31 days.
August has 31 days.
From September 1 to September 17 is 17 days.

Adding these together: 22 + 31 + 31 + 17 = 101 days.

Since there are approximately 30 days in a month, we divide 101 days by 30 to get the number of months.

101 / 30 ≈ 3.37 months

Therefore, approximately 3 months and 11 days separated the first flight from the introduction, but if we consider whole months, it's about 3 months.

3. Full years served: 1968, 1969, 1970, 1971, 1972 = 5 years.
4. Adding the partial years:

From the information given:
- Libya supported the Derg (the other side) from 1985 to 1991.

Now let's calculate the duration of support for each side:
- Support for the Derg: 1991 - 1985 = 6 years
- Support for the EPRDF: 1985 - 1977 = 8 years

Next, we'll find the difference between the years of support:
8 years (support for EPRDF) - 6 years (support for Derg) = 2 years

- Gabi Ashkenazi's leadership duration: 2011 - 2006 = 5 years
- Ehud Olmert's leadership duration: 2009 - 2006 = 3 years

- Appointed as Bishop: 29 April 1912

Now, let's calculate the difference in years:
1. Calculate the years difference first: 1912 - 1882 = 30 years
2. Determine if there are additional months or days to consider. Since April 29 is before July 7 in the same year, we do not need to add an extra year.

Therefore, it took 30 years from his ordination as a priest until his appointment as Bishop.

However, since she began skating midway through 1993, it is more accurate to say she won her first medal 14 years and several months after starting to skate.

[""Consolidated PBV-1A Catalina '433915' Miss Pick Up (G-PBYA).jpg"", 'A restored OA-10 Catalina in US Army Air Corps colors']

","To find out how many years passed between the PBY Catalina's first flight and its retirement by the United States Navy Reserve, we need to calculate the difference between the two dates.

First flight: 21 March 1935
Retirement (United States Navy Reserve): January 1957

We can calculate the time difference as follows:
- From 21 March 1935 to 21 March 1957 is 22 years.
- Since the retirement date is January 1957, it means the actual period is less than 22 years but still in the same year, 1957.

Therefore, the exact period would be from March 1935 to January 1957, which is 21 years and 10 months. However, typically such periods are rounded off to whole years unless specified otherwise.

","Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer made their first appearance in 1939. Rusty, who is mentioned as Rudolph's brother in ""Holidaze: The Christmas That Almost Didn't Happen,"" should be considered for the question's context as a relative introduced later. However, since Rusty is specifically asked about and there is no exact year provided for Rusty’s introduction, we can infer it was introduced sometime after other adaptations like the 1998 film. For the sake of this calculation, let's use the 1998 film as a reference point, as it is the earliest given adaptation mentioning family members in a specific movie context.

To find how many years passed between Rudolph's first appearance and the introduction of Rusty:
1. Rudolph's first appearance: 1939
2. Introduction of Rusty: around or after 1998 (as per ""Holidaze: The Christmas That Almost Didn't Happen"")

Subtract the first appearance year from the introduction year:
1998 - 1939 = 59 years

- Walter von Brauchitsch's term began in 1939.
- Franklin D. Roosevelt's term began in 1944.

Subtracting the start year of Walter von Brauchitsch's term from the start year of Franklin D. Roosevelt's term gives us:

","""3 a.m. Eternal"" was released on Pure Trance 2 in May 1989, and it was released as part of The KLF vs ENT version in January 1992. To calculate the number of years between these releases:
1. Determine the release dates: May 1989 and January 1992.
2. Calculate the difference: From May 1989 to May 1992 is 2 full years and 8 additional months.
3. Since the release in January 1992 comes before May 1992, we subtract one month from the 8-month period, making it 7 months.
4. Therefore, the total time difference is 2 years and 7 months.

Since the question asks for the number of years, we can state this as approximately 2.6 years, but typically such questions expect whole years unless specified otherwise. Hence, we can say it took about 3 years if rounding up, but strictly speaking, it’s 2 years plus some months.

Final Answer: 2 years and 8 months (or approximately 3 years if rounding up)"

For the 8th Minister of National Education:
He served from 30 July 1953 to 12 August 1955.

For the 14th Minister of Information:
He served from 6 March 1962 to 17 October 1962.

The time period between these two offices can be calculated by subtracting the end date of his term as the 8th Minister of National Education from the start date of his term as the 14th Minister of Information.

From 12 August 1955 to 6 March 1962:
1962 - 1955 = 7 years
Then, we need to account for the months and days:
From August 12, 1955, to March 6, 1962, there are 6 years and 6 months plus some days. Since we're focusing on years, we'll consider this as approximately 6 years and 11 months.

Therefore, the total duration is about 7 years.

","To find out how many years after opening the stadium was renovated, we need to calculate the difference between the opening date and the renovation date.

1. The stadium opened on 12 September 1926.
2. The stadium was renovated on 5 December 2009.

Now, we calculate the difference between these dates:

- From 12 September 1926 to 12 September 2009 is exactly 83 years.
- From 12 September 2009 to 5 December 2009 is 23 days.

Since the question asks for the number of years, we can approximate the additional 23 days as a fraction of a year, but typically such calculations round to the nearest whole year unless specified otherwise.

Therefore, the stadium was renovated approximately 83 years after it opened.

1 January 1917	Closed
7 July 1919	Re-opened
1 February 1925	Renamed | Cheltenham Spa Malvern Road
3 January 1966	Closed

","The station opened as Cheltenham Malvern Road on 30 March 1908 and was renamed Cheltenham Spa Malvern Road on 1 February 1925. To find out how many years passed between these events, we need to calculate the difference between these two dates.

From 30 March 1908 to 1 February 1925:
- From 30 March 1908 to 1 February 1909 is 10 months and 2 days.
- From 1 February 1909 to 1 February 1925 is exactly 16 years.

Adding these together:
- 10 months and 2 days in the first year.
- Plus 16 full years.

Since we are asked for the number of years, we can consider only the complete years:
1925 - 1908 = 17 years

However, since the renaming happened before the end of the 17th year, the correct count is 16 years and some additional months. But based on the question asking for years, the primary component is 16 full years.

","The 2021 Myanmar coup d'état occurred on February 1, 2021. According to the information provided, new elections have been deferred to August 2023. 

To calculate how many years this is from the coup, we can consider the timeline:

- From February 2021 to February 2023 is 2 years.
- Adding the additional months until August 2023 means it will be slightly more than 2 years but less than 3 years.

Since the exact month in 2023 when elections are deferred (August) is specified, the deferral period is more precisely described as extending into the third calendar year post-coup.

","To determine how many years passed between the adoption of the constitution and the abolition of the monarchy, we need to find the dates for both events and calculate the difference.

From the table:
- The constitution was adopted on 16 July 1931.
- The monarchy was abolished on 21 March 1975.

Now, let's calculate the difference:
- From 16 July 1931 to 16 July 1975 is 44 years.
- From 16 July 1975 to 21 March 1975 is 8 months and 5 days.

Since the exact number of days is not critical for this calculation and we typically consider years in whole numbers, we can conclude that the period is approximately 43 years and 8 months.

For simplicity, we can say it took around 44 years from the adoption of the constitution until the monarchy was abolished.

","To determine how many years passed between the death of Richard Caswell's first wife and his own death, we need to follow these steps:

1. Identify the year Richard Caswell's first wife died.
2. Identify the year Richard Caswell died.
3. Subtract the year of his first wife's death from the year of his death.

From the table:
- Mary Mackilwean, Richard Caswell's first wife, died in 1757.
- Richard Caswell died on November 10, 1789.

Now, calculate the difference:
1789 - 1757 = 32 years

B-24 Skua
Role	Carrier-based dive bomber/fighter | Type of aircraft
Manufacturer	Blackburn Aircraft
First flight	9 February 1937
Introduction	November 1938
Retired	1941 (withdrawn from front line) | March 1945 (withdrawn from other duties)
Primary user	Fleet Air Arm
Number built	192
Variants	Blackburn Roc
['15 Blackburn Skua, Bristol Perseus (15650612347).jpg', 'Blackburn Skua in flight']

","The B-24 Skua had its first flight on 9 February 1937 and was introduced in November 1938. To calculate the number of years between these two dates, we consider only full years:
- From February 1937 to February 1938 is one year.
- From February 1938 to November 1938 is less than a year, so it does not add another full year.

Therefore, the B-24 Skua was introduced 1 year and some months after its first flight, but in terms of full years, it's 1 year.

","The Firefly had its first flight on December 22, 1941, and was retired in 1956 from the Royal Navy. To find out how many years passed between these dates, we subtract the year of the first flight from the year of retirement: 1956 - 1941 = 15 years. However, since the first flight occurred later in 1941, the exact number of years is slightly less than 15, but typically such calculations consider full years, so we generally say 15 years.

","To determine how many years passed between the first launch at the Satish Dhawan Space Centre and the first launch from its second launch pad, we need to identify the dates of these events and calculate the difference.

1. The first launch at the Satish Dhawan Space Centre occurred on 9 August 1979.
2. The first launch from the Second Launch Pad occurred on 5 May 2005.

Now, let's calculate the difference in years between these two dates:

From 9 August 1979 to 5 May 2005:
- From 9 August 1979 to 5 May 2005 spans 25 years and approximately 8 months.

Therefore, the first launch from the Second Launch Pad occurred 25 years and 8 months after the first launch at the Satish Dhawan Space Centre. Since the question asks for the number of years, we can round down to the nearest whole number.

3. Calculate the difference in years between her 18th birthday and the gold medal win.

Step 1: According to the table, Brit Pettersen was born on 24 November 1961. Therefore, she turned 18 in 1979 (since 1961 + 18 = 1979).

Step 2: The table shows that she won a gold medal in the Junior World Championships in 1980 in Örnsköldsvik.

Step 3: Since she turned 18 in 1979 and won the gold medal in 1980, the difference in years is 1980 - 1979 = 1 year.

","To determine how many years ago Robby Gordon first won the Stadium Super Trucks, we need to identify his debut season and his first win within that series.

From the table, we can see:
- Debut season: 2013
- Championships: 2 (in 2013-2014)
- Wins: 29 (total wins)

Since Robby Gordon debuted in 2013 and the table shows he won championships in 2013 and 2014, it's reasonable to infer that he achieved his first win sometime during or shortly after his debut in 2013.

Now, to find out how many years ago this was from the current date (December 2022):
- Current year: 2022
- Year of first win: 2013
- Years ago: 2022 - 2013 = 9

1. AT&T Inc.'s founding date is October 5, 1983.
2. Current date is December 2022.
3. Calculate the difference in years between these two dates:
   - From October 5, 1983, to October 5, 2022, is 39 years.
   - Since it's currently December 2022, we are past the October 5th anniversary, so we do not subtract another year.

Basketball Hall of Fame as player

College Basketball Hall of Fame | Inducted in 2006

","To find out how many years ago Nate Archibald was inducted into the Basketball Hall of Fame, we need to know when he was inducted and compare it to the current year (December, 2022).

From the table, there is no direct mention of when Nate Archibald was inducted into the Basketball Hall of Fame as a player. However, it does state that he is in the Basketball Hall of Fame as a player, implying he was inducted sometime before the information was recorded.

Since the exact induction year isn't given, let's consider the College Basketball Hall of Fame induction year, which is mentioned: 2006. This can be used as a reference point because if Archibald was inducted into the College Basketball Hall of Fame in 2006, he would likely have been inducted into the main Basketball Hall of Fame prior to or around the same time. 

Now, calculate the difference between 2022 and 2006: 
2022 - 2006 = 16 years

Final Answer: 16 years (This is based on his College Basketball Hall of Fame induction year since his main Basketball Hall of Fame induction year wasn't directly stated.)"

['15 Blackburn Skua, Bristol Perseus (15650612347).jpg', 'Blackburn Skua in flight']

","To calculate how many years have passed since the first flight of the B-24 Skua, we need to know the current date and the date of the first flight. The current date is December 2022, and the first flight of the B-24 Skua was on 9 February 1937. 

Now, let's calculate the difference:

1. From February 9, 1937, to February 9, 2022, is 85 years.
2. Since we're in December 2022, we need to account for the additional months from February to December in 2022. This adds another 10 months to the calculation.
3. However, the typical approach for such questions is to use the full years unless specified otherwise. Therefore, we'll consider the full years up until the current year.

So, considering just the years, it's been 85 years since its first flight.

","The INS Vikramaditya was not decommissioned in the Soviet Union or Russia. Instead, it was originally built for the Soviet Navy under the name Admiral Gorshkov, and was decommissioned in 1996 when it was no longer in use by the Soviet Navy. However, the question asks about decommissioning in the context of its service in India, where it was commissioned into the Indian Navy and is still in active service.

Since the ship was never decommissioned by India and is currently in active service, there is no decommissioning date relevant to India. But if we consider the decommissioning in the Soviet Union, it happened in 1996.

To calculate how many years ago this was from December 2022:
2022 - 1996 = 26 years

However, since the question specifically asks for the decommissioning in the context of Soviet Union/Russia and the ship's service in India does not have a decommissioning event yet, the correct interpretation based on the available information would be related to the Soviet Union.

","To find out how many years are between Argentina's first international match and their biggest defeat by Czechoslovakia, we need to identify the dates of these events and calculate the difference.

1. Argentina's first international match took place on July 20, 1902, against Uruguay in Montevideo, Uruguay.
2. Their biggest defeat by Czechoslovakia happened on June 15, 1958, in Helsingborg, Sweden.

Now, let's calculate the difference in years:

- First ODI: v. England at the Melbourne Cricket Ground, Melbourne; 5 January 1971
- Last T20I: v. Sri Lanka at Pallekele International Cricket Stadium, Pallekele; 11 June 2022

Now, we calculate the difference between these two dates:

- First ODI: January 5, 1971
- Last T20I: June 11, 2022

The difference in years is calculated as follows:
2022 - 1971 = 51 years

To determine if there are any partial years, consider the specific dates:
- From January 5, 1971, to January 5, 2022, is exactly 51 years.
- Adding the remaining months and days (January 6, 2022, to June 11, 2022) confirms it does not add up to a full additional year.

Therefore, the total number of years between the first ODI and the last T20I is 51 years.

","To determine how many years before his death Miloš Obrenović I began his second reign as Prince of Serbia, we need to identify the dates for both events:

1. The beginning of his second reign as Prince of Serbia:
   - The table indicates his reign as Prince of Serbia began on 6 November 1817.
   
2. His date of death:
   - According to the table, Miloš Obrenović I died on 26 September 1860.

Next, calculate the difference in years between these two dates:
- From 6 November 1817 to 26 September 1860.

First, let's calculate the full years:
- 1860 - 1817 = 43 years.

Since we have specific months and days, we need to check if the period includes a complete additional year:
- From 6 November 1817 to 26 September 1860 does not span another full year since 6 November comes after 26 September.

Therefore, the total number of years is exactly 43 years.

","To determine how many years Ambrose Rayappan served as Archbishop Emeritus of Pondicherry and Cuddalore, we need to identify when his term as Archbishop ended and when he died.

From the information provided:
- Term ended as Archbishop: 17 March 1973
- Died: 24 November 1999

Next, calculate the difference between these dates:

","Bayinnaung ruled as the Suzerain of Siam from 18 February 1564 until his death on 10 October 1581.

To calculate the duration of his reign over Siam:
1. Start date: 18 February 1564
2. End date: 10 October 1581

We need to count the full years and the partial years separately:
- From 18 February 1564 to 18 February 1581 is exactly 17 full years.
- From 18 February 1581 to 10 October 1581 is less than a full year but still part of his reign.

Since we're asked for the number of years, we can consider the partial year as contributing to the total, thus rounding up to include it as a full year.

Therefore, Bayinnaung ruled as the Suzerain of Siam for 17 years plus the partial year, totaling 17 full years and some additional months.

- Duration: From 27 August 1941 to 9 March 1942 is approximately 6 months and 13 days.

","Peter III's reign as King of Sicily began on 4 September 1282 and ended in November 1285. To calculate the duration of his reign, we need to determine the difference between these dates.

From September 1282 to August 1285 is 3 years. Since he ruled until November 1285, we add an additional month to the 3 years, making it almost 3 full years plus a partial fourth year.

However, when calculating regnal periods, typically only full years are counted unless specified otherwise. Thus, Peter III reigned as King of Sicily for 3 years.

","Theo Bot served as the Ambassador of the Netherlands to Austria from 17 January 1968 until 1 July 1973. To calculate the number of years he served, we can consider the difference between these dates:

1 July 1973 - 17 January 1968 = 4 years, 11 months, and 14 days.

Since the question asks for the number of years he served, we can round this to the nearest whole number, which is 5 years.

","To find out how many years it took for inflation in France to decrease by 0.8%, we need to compare the inflation rates given for different years.

From the data provided:
- Inflation in 2018 was 2.1%
- Inflation in 2019 was 1.3%
- Inflation in 2020 (estimated) was 0.5%

We can see that the decrease of 0.8% occurred from 2018 to 2020.

Calculation:
2.1% (2018) - 0.5% (2020) = 1.6% total decrease
But we're interested in the 0.8% decrease specifically:
2.1% (2018) - 1.3% (2019) = 0.8% decrease

This means the 0.8% decrease happened from 2018 to 2019, which is over a period of one year.

","To determine how many years it took for the Human Development Index (HDI) of France to grow by 0.089 points, we need to compare the HDI values given in the table and calculate the time difference between those values.

From the table, we have two relevant HDI figures:
- 0.909 (very high) (2020)
- 0.820 (very high) (IHDI, 2019)

However, the difference between these figures is not 0.089. Instead, we should look for the correct data points where the HDI increased by exactly 0.089 points.

The correct figures would be:
- 0.820 (2019)
- 0.909 (2020)

The difference between these figures is 0.909 - 0.820 = 0.089 points.

Now, we calculate the time difference between 2019 and 2020:
2020 - 2019 = 1 year

Therefore, it took 1 year for the Human Development Index of France to grow by 0.089 points.

Role	Carrier-based dive bomber/fighter | Type of aircraft
Manufacturer	Blackburn Aircraft
First flight	9 February 1937
Introduction	November 1938
Retired	1941 (withdrawn from front line) | March 1945 (withdrawn from other duties)
Primary user	Fleet Air Arm
Number built	192

['15 Blackburn Skua, Bristol Perseus (15650612347).jpg', 'Blackburn Skua in flight']

","The B-24 Skua was introduced in November 1938 and was completely retired in March 1945. To calculate the number of years it flew, we can find the difference between these two dates:

1. From November 1938 to November 1944 is exactly 6 years.
2. From November 1944 to March 1945 is about 4 months.

Adding these periods together gives us approximately 6 years and 4 months. Since the question asks for the number of years, we can round this to 6 full years, as the additional 4 months do not complete another year.

However, since the chapel was closed from 1873 to 1949, the actual period of closure ended in 1949, the same year it was consecrated.

","Miloš Obrenović I's reign as Prince of Serbia started on 6 November 1817 and ended on 25 June 1839. To calculate the number of years his reign lasted, we can simply find the difference between these dates.

From November 6, 1817, to November 6, 1839, is 22 years. Since his reign continued until June 25, 1839, this means it actually lasted a bit less than 22 full years. Specifically, it lasted until the end of June, which is about 7 months short of a full 22nd year.

Therefore, Miloš Obrenović I's reign as Prince of Serbia lasted 21 full years plus about 7 months, which we generally consider as 22 years when giving a rounded figure.

","To find out how many years elapsed from the beginning of Bayinnaung's reign as Suzerain of Lan Na to the end of his first reign as Suzerain of Lan Xang, we need to identify the start and end dates for both reigns.

1. **Suzerain of Lan Na**: 
   - Start Date: 2 April 1558
   - End Date: 10 October 1581

2. **First Reign as Suzerain of Lan Xang**:
   - Start Date: 2 January 1565
   - End Date: c. January 1568

Next, we calculate the duration of Bayinnaung's first reign as Suzerain of Lan Xang:
- From 2 January 1565 to January 1568, which is approximately 3 years.

Now, we determine the time elapsed from the start of his reign as Suzerain of Lan Na to the end of his first reign as Suzerain of Lan Xang:
- From 2 April 1558 to January 1568.

Let's break this down:
- From 2 April 1558 to 31 December 1558: 9 months.
- From 1 January 1559 to 31 December 1567: 9 years.

Adding these durations together:
- 9 months + 9 years = 9 years and 9 months.

Since we only need the number of years, we consider the full years:
- 9 years and 9 months is approximately 9 years.

","The Salvadoran Civil War began on 15 October 1979 and the picture of Ronald Reagan and José Napoleón Duarte was taken in 1985. To calculate how many years into the war this picture was taken, we need to find the difference between these two dates.

First, convert both dates to a common format for easy calculation. For simplicity, we'll use the year component only since we're dealing with whole years:
- Start of the war: 1979
- Picture taken: 1985

Subtract the start year from the year the picture was taken:
1985 - 1979 = 6

Therefore, the picture was taken 6 years into the war.

From January 1939 to December 1940 is 2 full years.
From January 1941 to December 1941 is another full year.

","To determine how many years longer Nicki Minaj's relationship with Safaree Samuels lasted compared to Meek Mill, we need to calculate the duration of each relationship.

For Safaree Samuels:
- Start date: 2000
- End date: 2014
Duration = 2014 - 2000 = 14 years

For Meek Mill:
- Start date: 2015
- End date: 2017
Duration = 2017 - 2015 = 2 years

Now, subtract the duration of the relationship with Meek Mill from the duration of the relationship with Safaree Samuels:
14 years - 2 years = 12 years

Final Answer: 12 years"

","To determine how many more years Scottie Pippen played for the Chicago Bulls compared to the Portland Trail Blazers, we need to calculate the duration of his time with each team.

First, let's find out how long Pippen played for the Chicago Bulls:
Pippen's tenure with the Chicago Bulls was from 1987 to 1998. This gives us a total of:
1998 - 1987 = 11 years

Next, let's calculate how long Pippen played for the Portland Trail Blazers:
Pippen's tenure with the Portland Trail Blazers was from 1999 to 2003. This gives us a total of:
2003 - 1999 = 4 years

Now, we subtract the number of years he played for the Portland Trail Blazers from the number of years he played for the Chicago Bulls:
11 years (Chicago Bulls) - 4 years (Portland Trail Blazers) = 7 years

","To find how many years longer the orbiter's planned mission duration is compared to its current elapsed duration, we need to convert both durations into years and then subtract the elapsed duration from the planned duration.

Step 1: Convert the orbiter's planned mission duration into years.
The orbiter's planned mission duration is ~7.5 years.

Step 2: Convert the orbiter's elapsed duration into years.
The orbiter's elapsed duration is given as 2 years, 10 months. Since there are approximately 12 months in a year, we can convert 10 months into years by dividing 10 by 12, which gives us about 0.83 years. Adding this to the 2 years gives us an elapsed duration of approximately 2.83 years.

Step 3: Subtract the elapsed duration from the planned duration.
Planned duration - Elapsed duration = 7.5 years - 2.83 years = 4.67 years.

","To find out how many years longer Gordon's NASCAR Xfinity Series career was compared to his IndyCar Series career, we need to determine the duration of each career and then subtract the shorter one from the longer one.

First, let's calculate the duration of Gordon's NASCAR Xfinity Series career:
- First race: 2001 GNC Live Well 250 (Watkins Glen)
- Last race: 2011 NAPA Auto Parts 200 (Montreal)

Next, let's calculate the duration of Gordon's IndyCar Series career:
- First race: 1996 Las Vegas 500K (Las Vegas)
- Last race: 2004 Indianapolis 500 (Indy)

","To find out how many years longer Mohammad-Ali Foroughi's second term as Prime Minister was compared to his first term, we need to calculate the duration of each term and then compare them.

First Term:
Start Date: 27 August 1941
End Date: 9 March 1942
Duration: 204 days (From 27 Aug 1941 to 9 Mar 1942)

Second Term:
Start Date: 18 September 1933
End Date: 3 December 1935
Duration: 2 years, 2 months, and 16 days (From 18 Sep 1933 to 3 Dec 1935)

Let's convert both terms into years for easier comparison:
- First Term: 204 days = 0.558 years (approximately)
- Second Term: 2 years, 2 months, and 16 days = 2 + (2/12) + (16/365) ≈ 2.202 years (approximately)

Now, subtract the duration of the first term from the second term:
2.202 - 0.558 = 1.644 years

Therefore, Mohammad-Ali Foroughi's second term as Prime Minister was approximately 1.644 years longer than his first term.

","To determine how many years longer Peter III's reign was as King of Aragon and Valencia compared to his reign as King of Sicily, we need to calculate the duration of each reign separately and then find the difference.

1. **Calculate the duration of Peter III's reign as King of Aragon and Valencia:**
   - Reign Start: 27 July 1276
   - Reign End: November 1285
   Duration: 1285 - 1276 = 9 years

2. **Calculate the duration of Peter III's reign as King of Sicily:**
   - Reign Start: 4 September 1282
   - Reign End: November 1285
   Duration: 1285 - 1282 = 3 years

3. **Find the difference in durations:**
   - Reign as King of Aragon and Valencia: 9 years
   - Reign as King of Sicily: 3 years
   Difference: 9 - 3 = 6 years

Therefore, Peter III's reign as King of Aragon and Valencia was 6 years longer than his reign as King of Sicily.

","First, calculate the duration of his term as the 8th Minister of National Education:
End date: 12 August 1955
Start date: 30 July 1953
Duration: 12 August 1955 - 30 July 1953 = 2 years and 1 month + 12 days

Second, calculate the duration of his term as the 6th Minister of Law:
End date: 3 April 1952
Start date: 27 April 1951
Duration: 3 April 1952 - 27 April 1951 = 11 months and 7 days

Now, compare the durations:
Duration as 8th Minister of National Education: 2 years and 1 month + 12 days
Duration as 6th Minister of Law: 11 months and 7 days

Convert both durations into months for easier comparison:
2 years and 1 month + 12 days ≈ 25 months + some days
11 months and 7 days ≈ 11 months + some days

Subtract the shorter period from the longer one:
25 months + some days - 11 months + some days ≈ 14 months

Therefore, Yamin was in office as the 8th Minister of National Education for approximately 14 months longer than as the 6th Minister of Law.

","To determine how long Zidane's senior career was compared to his youth career, we first need to calculate the duration of each period.

For the youth career:
- From 1981 to 1982: 1 year
- From 1982 to 1983: 1 year
- From 1983 to 1986: 3 years
- From 1986 to 1989: 3 years
Adding these durations gives us a total of 1 + 1 + 3 + 3 = 8 years for the youth career.

For the senior career:
- From 1989 to 2006: 17 years
The senior career lasted from 1989 to 2006, which is 17 years.

Now, we find the difference between the senior career and the youth career:
17 years (senior career) - 8 years (youth career) = 9 years

1. **Calculate the duration of the period between the Hammadid and the Zayyanid dynasties:**
   - Hammadid dynasty began: 1015
   - Zayyanid dynasty began: 1236
   - Duration = 1236 - 1015 = 221 years

2. **Calculate the duration of the period between the Rustamid and the Zirid dynasties:**
   - Rustamid dynasty began: 776
   - Zirid dynasty began: 972
   - Duration = 972 - 776 = 196 years

3. **Compare the durations:**
   - Difference = 221 years - 196 years = 25 years

Therefore, the period between the Hammadid and the Zayyanid dynasties lasted 25 years longer than the period between the Rustamid and the Zirid dynasties.

- Second renovation: 2019-21

Now we calculate the duration of each renovation:
- Duration of the first renovation: Since only one year (2009) is given, we'll assume it was completed within the same year. So, the duration is approximately 1 year.
- Duration of the second renovation: From 2019 to 2021, which spans 3 years.

To find out how many years longer the second renovation was compared to the first:
- Difference in duration = Duration of the second renovation - Duration of the first renovation
- Difference in duration = 3 years - 1 year = 2 years

","To calculate how old the Palace of Westminster is, we need to consider when it was built and use the current date (December, 2022).

According to the table, the original structure was built in 1016.

Now, let's calculate the age:

Current Year: 2022
Year Built: 1016

Age = Current Year - Year Built
    = 2022 - 1016
    = 1006

However, note that the original building was destroyed due to fire in 1834 and was rebuilt between 1840 and 1876. But the age calculation refers to the initial construction date.

Final Answer: The Palace of Westminster is 1006 years old since its initial construction in 1016."

","The 2021 Myanmar protests aimed to abolish the 2008 Constitution. To find out how many years old the constitution was during the protests, we need to calculate the difference between 2021 and 2008.

Step 1: Identify the year the constitution was established.
The constitution was established in 2008.

Step 2: Identify the year of the protests.
The protests began on February 2, 2021.

Step 3: Calculate the age of the constitution during the protests.
Subtract the year the constitution was established from the year of the protests:
2021 - 2008 = 13 years

","Billie Mae Richards voiced Rudolph in TV specials from 1964 to 2010. The film where Blitzen was Rudolph's father is the 1998 film.

To find out how many years passed between the end of the Billie Mae Richards TV specials and the 1998 film:
1. Identify the end year of the TV specials: 2010
2. Identify the year of the 1998 film.
Since we need the time between the end of the TV specials and the 1998 film, we actually want to focus on when the 1998 film came out relative to the TV specials period:
3. Calculate the difference between 1998 and the start of the TV specials in 1964: 1998 - 1964 = 34 years.
However, since the question asks about the period ending in 2010 and starting from 1998, it would be:
4. 2010 - 1998 = 12 years.

But strictly speaking, the relevant timeline here is from the release of the 1998 film until the end of the TV specials:

","The first flight of the JF-17 Thunder was on 25 August 2003, and it was introduced on 12 March 2007.

To find the number of years between these two dates:
- From August 25, 2003, to August 25, 2007, is exactly 4 years.
- From August 25, 2007, to March 12, 2007, is less than a year but part of the same year.

Therefore, the total time span is 3 full years plus part of a fourth year. Since we typically measure such periods in whole years for simplicity, the primary duration is considered 3 years and 184 days (which is more than half a year).

However, when asked for the number of years, the most common approach is to round up if more than half a year has passed. Thus, the difference is generally considered 4 years.

","To find how many years prior to Agustín I's rule the Plan of Iguala took place, we need to identify the dates of both events:

1. The Plan of Iguala occurred on 24 February 1821.
2. Agustín I became Emperor in 1822 and ruled until 1823.

Since Agustín I's rule began in 1822, we calculate the time difference between the Plan of Iguala (February 1821) and when Agustín I started his rule (1822):

1822 - 1821 = 1 year.

Thus, the Plan of Iguala happened 1 year before Agustín I's rule began.

","To find out how many years separate Shi Yuqi's silver medal at the World Championships from his silver medal at the Asian Junior Championships, we need to identify the years in which each event occurred:

1. Shi Yuqi won a silver medal at the World Championships in 2018 in Nanjing.
2. Shi Yuqi won a silver medal at the Asian Junior Championships in 2014 in Alor Setar.

Next, we calculate the difference in years between these two events:
2018 - 2014 = 4 years

However, there seems to be a mismatch because Shi Yuqi would have been too old to compete in the Junior Championships in 2014 if he was born in 1996. Therefore, let's re-evaluate the Asian Junior Championships entry to ensure it's correct. Given the context, the only plausible silver medal from the list for junior level should be:

- Silver medal - second place | 2012 Alor Setar | Boys' singles

","The X-15's first flight was on 8 June 1959 and it was retired in December 1968. To find out how many years separated these events, we calculate the difference between the years of the first flight and retirement: 1968 - 1959 = 9 years. However, since the X-15 wasn't retired until December 1968, it had not completed its full 1968 year of service at the time of retirement, meaning it served less than a full year in 1968. Thus, the correct span is 9 full years plus part of a tenth year, but typically such spans are counted by full years unless specified otherwise.

1 January 1917	Closed
7 July 1919	Re-opened
1 February 1925	Renamed | Cheltenham Spa Malvern Road
3 January 1966	Closed

","To determine how many years Cheltenham Spa (Malvern Road) station was open before its first closure, we need to find the opening and closing dates.

From the history section:
- Opened as Cheltenham Malvern Road on 30 March 1908.
- Closed on 1 January 1917.

Now, calculate the difference between these dates:
- From March 30, 1908, to January 1, 1917, involves calculating the span across multiple years.

First, count the full years from April 1, 1908, to December 31, 1916:
- 1908: April 1 to December 31 = 9 months
- 1909 to 1916: 8 full years
- Total = 8 years + 9 months

Since the question asks for the number of years, we consider only the full years before adding the partial year:
- Full years: 8 years
- Partial year: 9 months (less than a full year)

Thus, Cheltenham Spa station was open for 8 years before it closed on January 1, 1917.

1 February 1925	Renamed | Cheltenham Spa Malvern Road
3 January 1966	Closed

","To find out how many years Cheltenham Spa station was operational after it reopened in 1919, we need to identify its closure date post-reopening.

From the key dates listed:
- Reopened on 7 July 1919.
- Closed again on 3 January 1966.

Now, calculate the period between the reopening and the second closure:
- From 7 July 1919 to 3 January 1966.

First, calculate the full years:
- From 7 July 1919 to 7 July 1965 = 46 years.

Then, account for the remaining days in 1965 to 3 January 1966:
- 1965 had 365 days.
- From 7 July to 31 December = 187 days.
- So, from 1 January to 3 January 1966 = 3 days.
- Total additional days = 187 + 3 = 190 days.

Since 190 days is less than a full year, it does not add another complete year to the count.

Thus, Cheltenham Spa station was operational for 46 years after reopening in 1919.

From 19 November 1909 to 19 November 1921 is exactly 12 years. Since his term ended on 3 August 1921, he would have completed slightly less than the full year of 1921. However, typically such terms are counted inclusively of both the starting and ending years unless specified otherwise.

Therefore, Foroughi was a member of the Parliament of Iran for 11 full years plus part of the 12th year.

","The X-15 was introduced on 17 September 1959 and retired in December 1968. To calculate the number of years it was in service, we need to determine the difference between these dates.
From 1959 to 1968 is a span of 9 years. Since it was introduced mid-year in 1959 but retired at the end of 1968, we need to account for only part of the first year (1959) and all of the years until the full year before retirement (1968), making it 9 complete years plus some part of the first year.

However, if we strictly count full years of service, we can say it completed service in its entirety up until the end of 1968, meaning it served for 9 full years.

","The X-15 had its first flight on 8 June 1959 and was retired in December 1968. To calculate the number of years between these dates, we find the difference between 1968 and 1959, which gives us 9 years. However, since the retirement date is in December and the first flight is in June, part of the initial year (1959) is included, but not all of the final year (1968), so we still count it as a full period.

Therefore, the total time span is 9 complete years plus some months at the beginning and end.

","Jeelani's college career lasted from 1972 to 1976, which is a total of 4 years.

Jeelani's NBA career included playing for Portland Trail Blazers from 1979 to 1980, and Dallas Mavericks from 1980 to 1981, which sums up to 2 years.

To find out how much longer his college career was compared to his NBA career, we subtract the length of his NBA career from his college career: 4 years - 2 years = 2 years.

However, the question asks how much longer his NBA career was than his college career, which based on the given data would be less than his college career duration. Since his NBA career was actually shorter, we can state it as how much shorter rather than longer:
His NBA career was 2 years shorter than his college career.

But strictly answering the question as asked (how much longer his NBA career was):
Final Answer: His NBA career was not longer, but instead 2 years shorter than his college career. However, if forced into the asked format, the answer would be 0 years since it cannot be longer, implying the question might need rephrasing."

Jurist term ends	16 October 2023

Deputy President
Currently	Uzi Vogelman
Since	9 May 2022
Lead position ends	16 October 2023
Jurist term ends	6 October 2024

","Esther Hayut's term as President ends on 16 October 2023.
Uzi Vogelman's term as Deputy President ends on 6 October 2024.

To find the difference in their terms, we calculate the time left for each and then find the difference:
- Esther Hayut's term ends in 2023.
- Uzi Vogelman's term ends in 2024.

The difference between 2024 and 2023 is 1 year.

However, since both terms end mid-year, we need to consider if there is any overlap or difference within the year:
- Esther Hayut's term ends on 16 October 2023.
- Uzi Vogelman's term ends on 6 October 2024.

From 16 October 2023 to 6 October 2024 is approximately 11 months. This means Uzi Vogelman's term extends into part of the next year beyond where Esther Hayut's term ends.

Therefore, Uzi Vogelman's term is slightly over 1 year longer than Esther Hayut's term. However, when asked how much longer in years, we consider whole years, which is 1 year.

","To find out how much longer 20th Century Studios was owned by News Corporation than by 21st Century Fox, we need to calculate the duration of ownership for both companies and then subtract the shorter period from the longer one.

First, let's determine the duration of ownership for each company:

1. **News Corporation**: 
   - Started owning 20th Century Studios: 1985
   - Ended owning 20th Century Studios: 2013
   - Duration: 2013 - 1985 = 28 years

2. **21st Century Fox**:
   - Started owning 20th Century Studios: 2013
   - Ended owning 20th Century Studios: 2019
   - Duration: 2019 - 2013 = 6 years

Now, we subtract the shorter period from the longer one:

28 years (News Corporation) - 6 years (21st Century Fox) = 22 years

Coat of arms	Ambrose Rayappan's coat of arms

","To find out how old Ambrose Rayappan was when he became Archbishop Emeritus of Pondicherry and Cuddalore, we need to first identify his term as Archbishop and then consider when he might have been appointed Emeritus status.

From the information given:
- Ambrose Rayappan's birth date: 25 February 1901
- Term as Archbishop: Installed on 25 March 1953, ended on 17 March 1973

Emeritus status usually refers to someone who continues to hold a title after retirement or stepping down from active duties. Given the context, we can infer that he likely became Archbishop Emeritus sometime after his term ended on 17 March 1973. However, no specific date for this transition is provided in the data. 

For the sake of answering the question based on available data, we'll calculate his age at the end of his term as Archbishop, assuming this is close to when he might have become Emeritus:

1. Calculate the number of years from birth to the end of his term as Archbishop:
   - End of term date: 17 March 1973
   - Birth date: 25 February 1901
   - Age at end of term: 1973 - 1901 = 72 years (since he hadn't had his birthday yet in 1973)

So, Ambrose Rayappan was approximately 72 years old when he ended his term as Archbishop.

2. He became Suzerain of Siam on 18 February 1564.

Now we calculate the age difference:
1564 - 1516 = 48 years

However, since his birthday is in January and his reign started in February, he would have turned 48 in January 1564, just before starting his reign as Suzerain of Siam. Therefore, he began his reign as Suzerain of Siam at the age of 48.

Final Answer: 48"

To determine how old she was when she won this silver medal:
1. Carolijn Brouwer was born on 25 July 1973.
2. The World Championships event took place in 2007.
3. Calculate age: 2007 - 1973 = 34 years old, but we need to consider the exact date since the event happened in October, which means she had already celebrated her birthday that year.
4. Since her birthday (25 July) is before October, she would have turned 34 in July 2007.

Therefore, Carolijn Brouwer was 34 years old when she won her last medal at the World Championships, which was a silver medal, not a gold.

Since the question asks about her last gold medal, which wasn't at the World Championships, there isn't a relevant gold medal to calculate her age for. However, answering based on the last medal listed:
Final Answer: Carolijn Brouwer was 34 years old when she won her last medal (a silver) at the World Championships in 2007. There is no gold medal listed for the World Championships."

","To determine how old Charlotte Atkinson was when she won the gold medal in the European Championships, we need to follow these steps:

1. Identify the year she won the gold medal at the European Championships.
2. Calculate her age based on her birth year and the year she won the gold medal.

From the table, we can see that Charlotte Atkinson won a gold medal at the European Championships in 2018 in Glasgow.

Charlotte Atkinson was born on November 29, 1996.

Now, let's calculate her age in 2018:

1. Subtract her birth year from the year she won the gold medal:
   2018 - 1996 = 22 years old.

2. Since the event took place in September and her birthday is in November, she would have turned 22 in November 2018, meaning she was 21 years old during the championships in September 2018.

Therefore, Charlotte Atkinson was 21 years old when she won the gold medal in the European Championships.

","To determine Chuck Howley's age when his NFL career began, we need to subtract the year his career started from his birth year.

From the table:
- Born: June 28, 1936
- Career history: Chicago Bears (1958-1959)

His career began in 1958. So, we calculate his age in 1958:
1958 - 1936 = 22

However, since his birthday is on June 28th, and the NFL season typically starts in September, he would have turned 22 in June, just before the start of his first season.
Therefore, his NFL career began when he was 22 years old.

","To determine Claire Leroy's age when she won the gold medal at the 2007 World Championships, we need to calculate the difference between the year of the championship and her birth year.

1. Identify Claire Leroy's birth year from the personal information: 1980.
2. Identify the year she won the gold medal at the World Championships: 2007.
3. Subtract her birth year from the year she won the gold medal: 2007 - 1980 = 27.

Therefore, Claire Leroy was 27 years old when she won the gold medal at the 2007 World Championships.

","To determine Claire Leroy's age when she won her first World Championships medal, we need to identify her earliest win and compare it to her birth year.

From the table, her earliest World Championships medal win is in 2004 in Annapolis, where she won a bronze medal. She was born on 9 March 1980.

To calculate her age in 2004, subtract her birth year from the year she won her first medal:
2004 - 1980 = 24

However, we must account for the specific dates. Since the event took place in 2004 and her birthday is on March 9th, she turned 24 years old during the event.

Final Answer: 24 years old"

","Cody Ware was born on November 7, 1995. The NASCAR PEAK Mexico Series entry shows his first race was in 2014, which means he was 285 days short of turning 9 years old. However, since it's unlikely someone would compete professionally at such a young age, we need to calculate his age based on whether his birthday had passed in 2014.

Since his birthday is November 7, and the year 2014 is mentioned, if his birthday had not yet occurred in 2014, he would have been 18 years old (as he turned 18 on November 7, 2013). If his birthday had already passed, he would have been 19 years old. Given the professional context, it’s reasonable to assume he was 19 years old when competing in the NASCAR PEAK Mexico Series in 2014.

","To find out how old Dawn McEwen was when she won the gold at the 2014 Sochi Olympics, we need to determine her age in 2014.

From the table, we know that Dawn McEwen was born on July 3, 1980.

Now, let's calculate her age in 2014:

2014 - 1980 = 34

Since the Olympics were held in Sochi in 2014, and her birthday is on July 3, she would have turned 34 during the Olympics if they occurred after her birthday. Given that the Olympics usually occur early in the year, we can conclude that she was 33 years old when the Olympics took place, as her 34th birthday had not yet occurred.

From the table, we know:
- Derrell Palmer was born on August 27, 1922.

Since the draft took place in 1943 and he was born in 1922, we can calculate his age as follows:
1943 - 1922 = 21

However, since his birthday is August 27, and the draft would have occurred sometime later in the year, he would have already turned 21 by the time of the draft.

1. From the table, we can see that Draško Nenadić was born on 15 February 1990.
2. According to the national team section, Draško Nenadić started playing for Serbia in 2012.

Now, calculate his age in 2012:

- Subtract the birth year from the year he started playing for the national team: 
  2012 - 1990 = 22

However, since his birthday is on February 15th, and we do not know the exact month and day he started playing for the national team, we should consider if he had already had his birthday in 2012 or not. Given that national teams typically select players later in the year, it's reasonable to assume he would have already turned 22 by the time he started playing for the national team.

3. Calculate the age by subtracting the birth year from the starting year of his career: 1990 - 1969 = 21.

Since his birthday is on May 15, and he started playing in 1990, if he had not yet had his birthday in 1990, he would be 20. However, since the exact month isn't specified for when he started playing but it is listed as 1990, we can safely assume he turned 21 by the time he started playing professionally.

","To find out how old Jeffrey Epstein was when he was apprehended, we need to calculate his age based on his birth year and the date he was apprehended.

Step 1: Identify Epstein's birth year.
According to the table, Jeffrey Epstein was born on January 20, 1953.

Step 2: Identify the date Epstein was apprehended.
The table states that Epstein was apprehended on July 6, 2019.

Step 3: Calculate Epstein's age at the time of apprehension.
From January 20, 1953, to July 6, 2019, is 66 years and 5 months and 16 days. However, since we typically measure age in whole years until the birthday following the event, we consider the age as of the end of the year 2018 (since the apprehension happened before his birthday in 2019).

Thus, Epstein was 66 years old at the time of his apprehension.

","To find out how old Timo Glock was during his last entry in the Formula One World Championship, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the date of Glock's birth: 18 March 1982.
2. Identify the date of his last entry in Formula One: 2012 Brazilian Grand Prix.
3. Calculate his age at that time.

Step 1: Birth Date
Timo Glock was born on 18 March 1982.

Step 2: Last Entry Date
His last entry in Formula One was the 2012 Brazilian Grand Prix, which took place in late October or early November 2012.

Step 3: Age Calculation
To calculate his age, we can consider that the event happened in late 2012, meaning he had already had his birthday earlier that year.
Age in 2012 = Year of Event - Year of Birth
Age in 2012 = 2012 - 1982 = 30

Since his birthday had already passed in 2012 when the last entry occurred, Glock was 30 years old during his last entry in the Formula One World Championship.

","To find out how old Heiko Kroeger was when he won a gold medal at the 2000 Olympics, we need to calculate his age based on his birth date and the year he won the gold medal.

1. Birth Date: 27 March 1966
2. Year of Gold Medal Win: 2000

Now, let's calculate his age in the year 2000:

- From 1966 to 2000 is 34 years.
- Since the gold medal was won in 2000, but the exact date isn't specified, we assume it happened sometime during that year. As his birthday is on March 27th, if the event happened before or on March 27, 2000, he would be turning 34. If it happened after March 27, he would have already turned 34.

Since the exact date of the medal win isn't given, and typically medals are awarded after the completion of the event, it's reasonable to assume that the event took place after his birthday.

Therefore, Heiko Kroeger was 34 years old when he won a gold medal at the 2000 Olympics.

- He won a Gold medal at the 2000 Sydney Paralympic Games.

Now we can determine his age in the year 2000:
2000 - 1966 = 34 years old.

However, since his birthday is on the 27th of March, and the Paralympics were held in the same year, we need to check if his birthday had already occurred in 2000 before the games took place. Since the Sydney Paralympic Games took place from September 18 to October 2, 2000, Heiko would have turned 34 during the games.

","Bill Hewitt was born on August 8, 1944. He played for the Chicago Bulls during the 1974 season. Since the exact date within the season isn't specified, we can use the end of the season as a reasonable approximation. Therefore, if we consider the end of the 1973-1974 season, which typically ends in April or June, Hewitt would have been around 29 years old.

Step 1: Determine Hewitt's birth year - 1944.
Step 2: Determine the year he played for the Chicago Bulls - 1974.
Step 3: Calculate his age in 1974: 1974 - 1944 = 30 years old.

However, since the specific month and time of the season aren't mentioned, we need to consider that he likely wasn't 30 until later in the year. Thus, he would have been 29 for most of the season.

Marina Alabau was born on 31 August 1985. She competed in the 2012 London Olympic Games.

Subtract her birth year from the year she competed in the Olympics:
2012 - 1985 = 27

However, since her birthday is on August 31st and the London Olympics took place in 2012, we need to check if her birthday had already occurred in 2012 before the Olympics. Given that the Olympics typically occur in July or August, and assuming it happened in July or early August, she would have turned 27 during the Olympics.

","To find out how old Mohammad Yamin was when he became Minister of National Education in 1953, we need to calculate his age based on his birth date and the date he took office.

1. Identify Mohammad Yamin's birth date: 24 August 1903.
2. Identify the date he became Minister of National Education: 30 July 1953.
3. Calculate the difference in years between 1903 and 1953: 1953 - 1903 = 50 years.

Since Mohammad Yamin had not yet had his birthday in 1953 (his birthday is on August 24), he was 50 years old when he became Minister of National Education in 1953.

","To find out how old Mohammad Yamin was when he took office as the 6th Minister of Law, we need to calculate the difference between his birth year and the year he took office.

From the information given:
- Mohammad Yamin was born on 24 August 1903.
- He took office as the 6th Minister of Law on 27 April 1951.

Since the exact month and day of birth and the day he took office are different, we'll consider only the years for simplicity. As his birthday (August 24) comes after the date he took office (April 27), he would not have had his birthday yet at the time of taking office. Therefore, he would still be considered 47 years old at the time he took office.

1951 - 1903 = 48 years old, but since it's before his birthday, it's 47.

","To find out how old Mohammad-Ali Foroughi was when he became a member of the Parliament of Iran, we need to first identify his birth year and the start year of his term in the Parliament.

From the table, we can see that Mohammad-Ali Foroughi was born in early August 1877.

His term as a Member of the Parliament of Iran started on 19 November 1909.

Now, let's calculate his age when he became a member of the Parliament:

1. Assume he was born on August 1, 1877 (since it says ""early August"").
2. From August 1, 1877, to November 19, 1909, is approximately 32 years and 3 months.

Therefore, Mohammad-Ali Foroughi was around 32 years old when he became a member of the Parliament of Iran.

","To find out how old Peter III was when he started his reign as King of Aragon and Valencia, we need to calculate the difference between his age at death and the duration of his reign.

First, let's determine his birth year based on his death age and the year he died:
- Peter III died in November 1285 at the age of 45-46.
- This means he was born around 1239 or 1240 (1285 - 45 = 1240, 1285 - 46 = 1239).

Next, let's identify the year he started his reign:
- Peter III's reign as King of Aragon and Valencia began on 27 July 1276.

Now, let's calculate his age when he started his reign:
- If Peter III was born around 1239, he would have been approximately 37 years old when he started his reign in 1276 (1276 - 1239 = 37).
- If Peter III was born around 1240, he would have been approximately 36 years old when he started his reign in 1276 (1276 - 1240 = 36).

Since the exact birth year is not specified precisely, we can conclude that Peter III was around 36 or 37 years old when he began his reign as King of Aragon and Valencia.

Final Answer: Around 36 or 37 years old"

","To find out how old Aruna Quadri was when he won the silver medal at the Commonwealth Games, we need to calculate the difference between his age at the time of the event and his birth year.

Step 1: Identify the year the Commonwealth Games took place.
The Silver medal was won in 2018.

Step 2: Find out the birth year of Aruna Quadri.
Aruna Quadri was born on 9 August 1988.

Step 3: Calculate his age during the 2018 Commonwealth Games.
Since the games took place in 2018 and he was born in 1988, we subtract the birth year from the year of the event: 
2018 - 1988 = 30

However, since the exact date of the event isn't specified and the games span several days, we need to confirm if his birthday had already passed in 2018 before the games. Given that the games were held in April, and his birthday is in August, his birthday would not have occurred yet in 2018. Therefore, he would still be considered 29 years old during the games.

","To find out how old Alessandro Riguccini was when he became active as a fighter, we need to compare his birth date with the start of his active years.

1. Determine Riguccini's birth date: 25 March 1988.
2. Identify the start of his active years: 1999 (as per ""Years active: 1999-present"").
3. Calculate the age difference between 1999 and 1988: 1999 - 1988 = 11 years.

Since his birthday is on the 25th of March, and assuming he started being active in 1999 before his birthday, he would have turned 11 years old during that year.

","To determine how old Roger Federer was when he won his first Olympic gold medal, we need to identify the year he won the gold medal and then calculate his age based on his birth year.

From the table, under the ""Other doubles tournaments"" section, it states that Federer won a Gold medal in 2008. However, this is not his first gold medal since the table also mentions a gold medal in doubles in 2008.

Looking further into the details, we see under ""Team competitions"" that there is no mention of a singles gold medal before 2008. The only gold medal mentioned is in doubles in 2008. Since the question asks about his first Olympic gold medal, we'll consider the 2008 doubles gold medal as his first one mentioned here.

Federer was born on 8 August 1981. In 2008, he would have turned 27 in August. Therefore, during the 2008 Olympics, he was 27 years old.

","To find out how old Roy Emerson was when he first won the French Open Doubles, we need to follow these steps:

1. Identify the year of his first French Open Doubles win.
2. Determine his birth year.
3. Calculate his age at the time of his first French Open Doubles win.

Step 1: From the Grand Slam doubles results section, we see that Roy Emerson's first French Open Doubles win was in 1960.

Step 2: From the 'Born' section, we see that Roy Emerson was born on 3 November 1936.

Step 3: Calculate his age in 1960:
   - The year 1960 minus the birth year 1936 equals 24.
   - Since his birthday is on November 3, and the tournament would have occurred before that date in 1960, he had already turned 24 by the time of the tournament.

Therefore, Roy Emerson was 24 years old when he first won the French Open Doubles.

From the table, we can see that Ryan Hunter-Reay was born on December 17, 1980.

The table also lists his awards, which include the ""Verizon IndyCar Series Rookie of the Year"" award for the year 2007.

Now, let's calculate his age in 2007:

- Birth year: 1980
- Year of winning Rookie of the Year: 2007

Age in 2007 = 2007 - 1980 = 27

Since his birthday is December 17, and the IndyCar Rookie of the Year award would have been given before the end of the racing season, he would still be 27 years old when he won it.

","To find out how old Ryan Hunter-Reay was when he won the Skip Barber National Championship in 1999, we need to calculate his age based on his birth year and month.

Step 1: Identify Ryan Hunter-Reay's birth year.
Ryan Hunter-Reay was born in 1980.

Step 2: Determine his age in 1999.
Subtract his birth year from the year he won the championship: 1999 - 1980 = 19.

Step 3: Verify if he had already had his birthday in 1999.
Since his birthday is December 17, and the championship would likely have been won earlier in the year, he would have turned 19 during that year.

","To determine Stephen Hawking's age when he received the BBVA Foundation Frontiers of Knowledge Award in 2015, we need to calculate the difference between the year of the award and his birth year.

From the table, we can see that Stephen Hawking was born on 8 January 1942 and received the BBVA Foundation Frontiers of Knowledge Award in 2015.

Now, let's do the calculation:
2015 - 1942 = 73

Therefore, Stephen Hawking was 73 years old when he received the BBVA Foundation Frontiers of Knowledge Award in 2015.

","To find out how old Stephen Hawking was when he wrote his thesis in 1966, we first need to know his birth year. According to the table, Stephen Hawking was born on January 8, 1942.

Now, we subtract his birth year from the year he wrote his thesis:
1966 - 1942 = 24

However, since his birthday was in January and we don't know the exact month and day his thesis was completed, it's possible he could have been 24 or turning 24 soon if his birthday had not occurred yet in 1966.

But generally, we can assume he was 24 when he wrote his thesis in 1966, unless his thesis was very early in 1966 before his birthday.

","To find out how old Steve Austin was when he originally retired from professional wrestling, we need to calculate his age based on his retirement date and birth date.

Step 1: Identify Steve Austin's original retirement date.
From the table, the original retirement date is March 30, 2003.

Step 2: Identify Steve Austin's birth date.
From the table, Steve Austin's birth date is December 18, 1964.

Step 3: Calculate Steve Austin's age at retirement.
To do this, we'll count the years between the birth date and the retirement date.

","Firstly, we need to find out in which event Stéphane Antiga medaled in Argentina. However, reviewing the given information, there's no mention of any medals won in Argentina. But since the question asks about the FIVB World League where he got a bronze medal in 2017 in Curitiba (which is not in Argentina but provides the closest relevant data), we'll use this information to answer the question.

Step 1: Determine Stéphane Antiga's birth year.
According to the table, Stéphane Antiga was born on 3 February 1976.

Step 2: Find the year he won the medal.
From the table, it shows he won a bronze medal in the FIVB World League in 2017 in Curitiba.

Step 3: Calculate his age in 2017.
To calculate his age in 2017, we subtract his birth year from 2017:
2017 - 1976 = 41

Since his birthday is on February 3rd and the World League event would have happened before or around this time, we can safely say he was 41 years old when he won the medal in 2017.

Step 1: Calculate his age in 2012.
\[ 2012 - 1986 = 26 \]

Step 2: Since his birthday is July 26, and the Olympics took place in August, he had already turned 26 by the time of the event.

Therefore, Thiago Alves was 26 years old when he won his first Olympic medal in 2012.

","To determine how old Tony Stewart was when he won his first NASCAR Cup Series race in 2002, we need to follow these steps:

1. Identify the birth date of Tony Stewart: May 20, 1971.
2. Determine the year of his first NASCAR Cup Series win: 2002.
3. Calculate his age in 2002: Subtract the birth year from the year of the win and add one because he had already had his birthday in that year.

Calculation:
2002 - 1971 = 31 years old.

Since his birthday (May 20) would have occurred before the race season typically starts in February, he would have turned 31 years old prior to winning his first NASCAR Cup Series race in 2002.

2. Determine the year she won her first gold medal at the Asian Junior Championships: 2006.
3. Calculate her age in 2006:

","To determine how old Aslam Watanjar was when he first took office as Minister of Defence, we need to find his birth year and the start date of his first term as Minister of Defence.

From the personal details section, we can see that Aslam Watanjar was born in 1946.

His first term as Minister of Defence was from April to 28 July 1979, according to the table. Since his exact birthday is May 31, 1952 (which seems to be a discrepancy since he was born in 1946), we will use the birth year to calculate his age at the start of his term in 1979.

Subtract the birth year from the start year of his first term:
1979 - 1946 = 33

Therefore, Aslam Watanjar was 33 years old when he took office as Minister of Defence for the first time.

","To find out how old Albert A. Michelson was when he won the Nobel Prize, we need to calculate his age based on his birth and Nobel Prize winning dates.

1. Albert A. Michelson was born on December 19, 1852.
2. He won the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1907.

Now let's calculate his age at the time of winning the Nobel Prize:

- From December 19, 1852, to December 19, 1907, is exactly 55 years.
- Since the Nobel Prize was awarded in 1907 and it's not specified if it was before or after his birthday, we assume it was awarded after his birthday for this calculation.

Therefore, he was 55 years old when he won the Nobel Prize.

","To determine Adolf von Baeyer's age when he won the Nobel Prize in Chemistry, we need to calculate the difference between his age at the time of the award and his birth year.

1. From the information provided, Adolf von Baeyer was born on 31 October 1835.
2. He won the Nobel Prize for Chemistry in 1905.
3. To find out how old he was in 1905, we subtract his birth year from the year he received the Nobel Prize:
   1905 - 1835 = 70 years old.

However, we should also consider his birthday. Since his birthday is on October 31, if the prize was awarded before or on that day in 1905, he would be turning 70. Given that there's no specific date mentioned for the award presentation, it's reasonable to assume he was 70 years old when he won the Nobel Prize.

","To determine how old the church was when it initially closed, we need to calculate the difference between its founding date and the initial closure date.

1. Founding date: 13th century
   - For simplicity, let's consider the founding date to be around 1250 AD (mid-13th century).
   
2. Initial closure date: 1873

Now, we can calculate the age of the church at the time of its initial closure:

3. Subtract the founding year from the closure year:
   - 1873 - 1250 = 623 years

Therefore, the church was approximately 623 years old when it initially closed.

From the table:
- Founded: 13th century
- Consecrated: 31 July 1949

First, we need to approximate the founding year within the 13th century. Since no exact year is given, let's assume it was founded around the middle of the 13th century for simplicity. The middle of the 13th century would be approximately 1250 AD.

Next, we calculate the age at the time of consecration:
- Year of consecration: 1949
- Assumed founding year: 1250

Subtract the founding year from the consecration year:
1949 - 1250 = 699

Therefore, the church was approximately 699 years old when it was consecrated.

Other related appearances
[' Republic of China (1924-1948)']

","To find out in what year China first participated in the Winter Olympics but not the Summer Olympics, we need to compare the years of their appearances in both the Winter and Summer Olympics.

From the table:
- China's Winter appearances include: 1980, 1984, 1988, 1992, 1994, 1998, 2002, 2006, 2010, 2014, 2018, 2022.
- China's Summer appearances include: 1952, 1956, 1960, 1964, 1968, 1972, 1976, 1980, 1984, 1988, 1992, 1996, 2000, 2004, 2008, 2012, 2016, 2020.

By comparing the years, we can see that China appeared in both Summer and Winter Olympics starting from 1980. Therefore, there is no year where China participated only in the Winter Olympics and not the Summer Olympics according to the given data.

However, if we look for the earliest year China participated in the Winter Olympics while skipping the Summer Olympics, we need to check the next Winter Olympics after 1980 where China didn't have a Summer Olympics appearance that year. The next Winter Olympics after 1980 is 1984, and China did not participate in the Summer Olympics in 1984.

Given the information provided, the exact beginning date is not explicitly stated, but it gives an end date which is often more precisely known. Since the question asks for when the dissolution began and the table provides a starting date of 16 November 1988, we can infer that this is when significant actions leading to the dissolution may have commenced.

","The planned mission duration for the orbiter was about 7.5 years, while the elapsed time given is 2 years, 10 months. First, we need to convert both durations into years for easy comparison.

Planned mission duration: 7.5 years

Elapsed time conversion:
- 2 years remain 2 years.
- 10 months need to be converted into years. Since there are approximately 12 months in a year, 10 months is roughly 10/12 or 0.83 years.

So, the elapsed time in years is approximately 2 + 0.83 = 2.83 years.

Now, subtract the elapsed time from the planned mission duration:
7.5 - 2.83 ≈ 4.67 years

Rounding up, the difference is 5 years.

Final Answer: 5 years"

","To determine the year Chen Yufei did not win a medal since 2013, let's examine her achievements starting from 2013:

- **2013**: 
  - Asian Junior Championships: Bronze medal in Mixed Doubles.
  
- **2014**:
  - World Junior Championships: Gold medal in Mixed Team.
  - Asian Junior Championships: Gold medal in Mixed Team and Girls' Singles.

- **2015**:
  - World Junior Championships: Gold medal in Mixed Team.
  - Asian Junior Championships: Gold medal in Mixed Team.

- **2016**:
  - World Junior Championships: Gold medal in Girls' Singles and Mixed Team.
  - Asian Junior Championships: Gold medal in Girls' Singles and Mixed Team.

- **2017**:
  - World Championships: Bronze medal in Women's Singles.
  - Sudirman Cup: Gold medal in Mixed Team.
  - Asian Junior Championships: Silver medal in Girls' Singles.
  
- **2018**:
  - Asian Games: Silver medal in Women's Team.
  - Asian Team Championships: Silver medal in Women's Team.

- **2019**:
  - World Championships: Bronze medal in Women's Singles.
  - Sudirman Cup: Gold medal in Mixed Team.
  
- **2020**:
  - Olympic Games: Gold medal in Women's Singles.
  - Uber Cup: Gold medal in Women's Team.
  
- **2021**:
  - Sudirman Cup: Gold medal in Mixed Team.

- **2022**:
  - Uber Cup: Silver medal in Women's Team.

From this list, we can see that every year from 2013 onward, Chen Yufei won at least one medal, except for **2019**, where she only won a bronze medal in the World Championships and gold medals in the Sudirman Cup. However, she still won medals in 2019.

By careful analysis, it appears Chen Yufei did not have a year without any medals since 2013. 

Final Answer: Chen Yufei did not have a year without winning a medal since 2013."

Vehicle information

Launch vehicle(s)	Space Shuttle

","To find out how many years passed between the Space Shuttle's first flight and its first crewed flight, we need to calculate the difference between the dates given for each event.

First flight: August 12, 1977
First crewed flight: April 12, 1981

From 1977 to 1981, there are 4 full years. However, we must also consider if part of those years have already passed by the time of the second event.

Since the first flight happened on August 12, 1977, and the first crewed flight occurred on April 12, 1981, the first crewed flight took place before the end of 1981's third month (April). Therefore, the period includes all of 1978, 1979, 1980, and part of 1981, but not the whole year of 1981.

Therefore, the total duration is indeed 4 years.

","To find out what age Paul Gauguin died at, we need to look at his birth and death dates.

- Born: 7 June 1848
- Died: 8 May 1903

Now calculate the difference between these two dates:

1. First, note the full years he lived: From 1848 to 1902 = 54 years
2. Then check if he reached his birthday in the final year: Since he died on May 8, 1903, and his birthday was June 7, 1848, he had not yet turned 55 in 1903.

Therefore, Paul Gauguin died at the age of 54.

","To find out Melissa Coates' age when she debuted at the IFBB Jan Tana Classic, we need to calculate the difference between the year of the event and her birth year.

Melissa Coates was born on June 18, 1971. She debuted at the IFBB Jan Tana Classic in 1996.

Now, subtract her birth year from the year of the event: 
1996 - 1971 = 25

However, since the event took place in 1996 and her birthday is in June, we need to check if the event happened before or after her birthday that year. Since the specific month and day of the event are not mentioned, it's reasonable to assume that if it occurred anytime during that year, she would already have turned 25 by then, unless it happened right before her birthday. Given no specific date, we can conclude she was 25 years old at the time of her debut at the IFBB Jan Tana Classic.

","To calculate the time difference in years between the first and last launch at Site 200/39, we need to subtract the date of the first launch from the date of the last launch and then round to the nearest year.

First launch: 20 February 1980
Last launch: 13 December 2021

Step 1: Calculate the exact difference in days
From 20 February 1980 to 13 December 2021 is calculated as follows:
- From 20 February 1980 to 13 December 2021 spans 41 years, 9 months, and 23 days.
- This translates to 41 full years plus additional days.

Step 2: Convert to years
41 years + (9 months + 23 days) / 365 ≈ 41 + 0.27 = 41.27 years

Step 3: Round to the nearest year
41.27 rounds to 41 when rounded to the nearest year.

","To find the time difference between the first and last launch at Site 200/40, we need to calculate the difference between the dates given for these events and round the result to the nearest year.

1. Identify the dates:
   - First launch: 23 July 1977
   - Last launch: 31 March 1991

2. Calculate the difference in years:
   - From 23 July 1977 to 23 July 1991 is exactly 14 years.
   - Since the last launch is on 31 March 1991, which is before 23 July 1991, we need to subtract one year to account for this earlier date.
   - Therefore, the total time difference is 14 - 1 = 13 years.

Rounding 13 years to the nearest year gives us 13 years.

","To determine the longest span between championships in One Day Internationals (ODI) for Australia, we need to identify all championship years and calculate the differences between them.

From the information provided:
- Best result for ODI: Champions (1987, 1999, 2003, 2007, 2015)

Let's list out the championship years:
1. 1987
2. 1999
3. 2003
4. 2007
5. 2015

Now let's calculate the spans between each consecutive championship:
- From 1987 to 1999: 1999 - 1987 = 12 years
- From 1999 to 2003: 2003 - 1999 = 4 years
- From 2003 to 2007: 2007 - 2003 = 4 years
- From 2007 to 2015: 2015 - 2007 = 8 years

Among these spans, the longest span is 12 years, which is between 1987 and 1999.

","To determine the most illustrious year of Derrick Brooks' career, we need to consider the significant achievements listed in his career highlights and awards. Here are some key achievements:

1. Super Bowl champion (XXXVII) - This indicates he won the Super Bowl in 2003 (as Super Bowl XXXVII was held in January 2003).
2. NFL Defensive Player of the Year (2002)
3. Walter Payton NFL Man of the Year (2000)
4. Five times First-team All-Pro (1999, 2000, 2002, 2004, 2005)
5. Eleven times Pro Bowl (1997-2006, 2008)

Among these, winning the NFL Defensive Player of the Year award is one of the highest individual honors a player can achieve. Additionally, being named First-team All-Pro multiple times and selected for numerous Pro Bowls also highlight his exceptional performance. However, 2002 stands out as it includes both the NFL Defensive Player of the Year award and First-team All-Pro recognition.

","The table does not provide a specific year when the Satish Dhawan Space Centre was named. However, it gives information about its first and last launches, which can give us context. The first launch mentioned is on 9 August 1979, while the table indicates the center is still active as of October 2022. Given this timeline, we can infer that the space center likely received its current name sometime after its establishment but before or around the time of its first launch. Since no exact year is provided in the given data, I cannot specify the exact year the center was named Satish Dhawan Space Centre. 

Final Answer: The year the Satish Dhawan Space Centre was named is not provided in the given information."

","The table provides information about two specific launch sites within Site 200 at Baikonur Cosmodrome. For Site 200/39, the first launch occurred on 20 February 1980. For Site 200/40, the first launch happened on 23 July 1977. Since we are asked for the earliest year of any first launch, we should choose the earlier date.

Step-by-step reasoning:
1. Identify the first launch dates for both sites:
   - Site 200/39: 20 February 1980
   - Site 200/40: 23 July 1977
2. Compare the years of these dates:
   - 1977 < 1980
3. Conclude that 1977 is the earliest year mentioned for a first launch.

","To find the last launch year, we need to compare the last launch dates from both launch pads mentioned in the table.

For Site 200/39:
- Last launch: 13 December 2021 | Proton-M / Ekspress-AMU3/7

For Site 200/40:
- Last launch: 31 March 1991 | Proton-K/DM-2 / Almaz 1

Between these two dates, 13 December 2021 is more recent than 31 March 1991.
