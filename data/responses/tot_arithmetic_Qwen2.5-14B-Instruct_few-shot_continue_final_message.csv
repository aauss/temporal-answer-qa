Adding these together gives 13 + 31 + 30 + 31 + 29 = 134 days.

Next, we need to find the next visit date after 134 days, given they visit every 17 days. Since they have visited once already, the next visit would be at 134 + 17 = 151 days from the start date.

Now, let's find the date 151 days from 18-04-2016:
- April: 13 days (as calculated earlier)
- May: 31 days

- July: 31 days
- August: 31 days
Total so far is 13 + 31 + 30 + 31 + 31 = 136 days, which exceeds 151 days.

Since they visit the restaurant every 13 days, we need to determine how many visits have occurred since their initial visit. We do this by dividing the total days by 13:

116 days / 13 days/visit ≈ 8.92 visits

This means they visited 8 times after their initial visit, and we need to find the next visit after today. Since 116 days is not exactly divisible by 13, we add 13 days to today's date to find the next visit:

Since a non-leap year has 365 days and a leap year has 366 days, we consider that 2008 is a leap year. We start by subtracting full years and then adjust for the extra day in a leap year.

First, let's see how many full years fit into 420 days:
- 420 days is slightly more than one year but less than two years. Specifically, 420 days is approximately 1 year and 55 days (since 366 days make up a leap year).

Now we subtract one year from November 28, 2008, to get to November 28, 2007. Then we subtract the remaining 55 days from November 28, 2007.

From November 28, 2007, we move backwards:
- Moving back 55 days includes moving back into October, September, and August. Counting backwards from November 28, we have:
  - November: 3 days (to the end of November)
  - October: 31 days
  - September: 21 days (from the start of September)

So, subtracting 3 + 31 + 21 = 55 days from November 28, 2007, lands us on August 31, 2007.

- From Mar 24 to Dec 31 of the previous year (2014): We need to go back through December, November, October, September, August, July, June, May, April, and the remaining days of March.

Summing up the days: 7 + 30 + 31 + 30 + 31 + 31 + 30 + 31 + 30 + 31 = 282 days. Since 282 days exceed 188, we only use the necessary portion:

Adding 365 days brings us to April 28, 1998 (since 1997 is not a leap year, we subtract one day from the initial date). Then adding the remaining 307 days (672 - 365) involves moving through the months:
- May (31 days): 31 days
- June (30 days): 61 days
- July (31 days): 92 days
- August (31 days): 123 days
- September (30 days): 154 days

- Adding 651 days to June 22, 2009:

Starting from March 27, 2006, we need to add 630 days. We'll do this incrementally by adding the days of each month until we reach or exceed 630 days. 

March 27 to March 31 = 5 days. 
April has 30 days, May has 31, June has 30, July has 31, August has 31, September has 30, October has 31, November has 30, December has 31, January has 31, February has 28 in 2006 (non-leap year), and March has 31 up to the 31st.

Adding up the days:
5 (remaining in March) + 30 (April) + 31 (May) + 30 (June) + 31 (July) + 31 (August) + 30 (September) + 31 (October) + 30 (November) + 31 (December) + 31 (January) + 28 (February) + 31 (March) = 367 days. This exceeds 630 days, so we backtrack. Subtracting 367 from 630 leaves us with 263 days remaining. Adding back one month at a time starting from April:

April to March = 365 days (a whole year), but we need only 263 days, so we don't complete a full year. We subtract 365 - 263 = 102 days left after completing a year. Then we subtract the days of each month until we get close:
102 - 31 (March) = 71 days remaining
71 - 30 (April) = 41 days remaining
41 - 31 (May) = 10 days remaining
So, 10 days into June from the start of the month.

Therefore, 90 weeks from March 27, 2006, lands on June 10, 2007."", ""date"": ""06"

We need to calculate the date that is 330 days from today. First, let's determine the number of days remaining in February 2003 starting from 2003-02-15: Since 2003 is not a leap year, February has 28 days. Days left in February: 28 - 15 + 1 = 14 days.

- March has 31 days
- April has 30 days
- May has 31 days
- June has 30 days
- July has 31 days
- August has 31 days
- September has 30 days

Adding up the days from February to September: 14 + 31 + 30 + 31 + 30 + 31 + 31 + 30 = 228 days. This means 228 days pass before October 1st, so we have 330 - 228 = 102 days left into October. October has 31 days, so we calculate the remaining days after October: 102 - 31 = 71 days left into November. November also has 30 days, leaving us with 71 - 30 = 41 days into December. December has 41 days, which means we reach exactly the 41st day of December.

We start by adding 1168 days to 2018-11-20:
- Adding 1168 days directly without breaking into years/months/days simplifies the process. We can use a date calculator or manually break down the days into years and months, but here we'll just add directly.

Next, we need to calculate the date 468 days from today. Since there are 365 days in a non-leap year, we start by determining how many complete years and extra days are covered in 468 days. Dividing 468 by 365 gives us 1 year and 103 days remaining.

Starting from June 13, 2015:
- Adding 1 year brings us to June 13, 2016.
- From June 13, 2016, adding 103 days requires us to navigate through the days in June, July, August, and September of 2016.

June has 18 days left (June 13 to June 30), July has 31 days, August has 31 days, and September has 13 days (as we only need to reach up to the 103rd day).

Adding these up: 18 (June) + 31 (July) + 31 (August) + 13 (September) = 93 days. We still have 103 - 93 = 10 days into October.

April has 30 days. Adding 5 days to 2011-Apr-25 takes us to 2011-May-01. Then subtract 5 days from the total (since we've already added 5 days), leaving 981 days.

2013 is not a leap year, so there are 365 days in that year. From September 5th, 2013 to December 31st, 2013 is 117 days (30 days in September, 31 in October, 30 in November, and 18 in December).

So, 1524 - 117 = 1407 days left after December 31, 2013. Dividing 1407 by 365 (number of days in a non-leap year), we get 3 years and 212 days. Adding 3 years to 2013 gives us 2016.

We start by breaking down the days into years and remaining days:
- 703 days / 365 days/year ≈ 1.926 years. This means there is 1 complete year and 338 days remaining (since 703 - 365 = 338).
- Adding 1 year to June 24, 2002, brings us to June 24, 2003.
- Next, we add 338 days to June 24, 2003. We can break this down further:
  - From June 24 to December 31, 2003: 190 days (considering 2003 is not a leap year)
  - Remaining days to be added: 338 - 190 = 148 days
- Starting from January 1, 2004, adding 148 days leads us through:
  - January: 31 days
  - February: 29 days (2004 is a leap year)
  - March: 88 days (148 - 31 - 29 = 88)
- Adding up the days in March:
  - 88 days into March includes all of March (31 days), plus 57 more days into April (88 - 31 = 57)

Next, we need to calculate the date that is 1141 days from November 10th, 2006. We can break down 1141 days into years, months, and days to simplify the calculation.

1. Calculate the number of complete years within 1141 days:
   - There are 365 days in a common year, and 366 in a leap year.
   - Dividing 1141 by 365 gives us approximately 3 years (since 3*365 = 1095 days).
   - This leaves us with 1141 - 1095 = 46 days remaining.

2. Determine the leap years within those 3 years:
   - From 2006 to 2009, only 2008 is a leap year.
   - So we add one extra day for the leap year, bringing the total to 1096 days covered by the 3 years.

3. With 46 days remaining, we need to add these days to November 10th, 2009:
   - Adding 46 days to November 10th, 2009:
     - November has 30 days, so adding 20 days brings us to November 30th, 2009.
     - We have 46 - 20 = 26 days left.
     - Adding 26 days to December 1st, 2009 brings us to December 26th, 2009.

First, let's determine how many days are left in September:
September has 30 days, and since today is September 30th, there are no days left in September.

Next, we subtract the days left in September from 1255:
1255 - 0 = 1255 days remaining to add.

Moving into October, November, December, January, February, March, April, May, June, July, August, and September again, we calculate the total days in each month from October 1st onwards:
October: 31 days
November: 30 days
December: 31 days
January: 31 days
February: 28 days (assuming non-leap year)
March: 31 days
April: 30 days
May: 31 days
June: 30 days
July: 31 days
August: 31 days
September: 30 days

Summing these up gives us 365 days in the first year, and adding another 365 days for the second year brings us to 730 days.

We can break down the calculation into years and days. There are 365 days in a non-leap year and 366 days in a leap year. Since 2004 is a leap year, we can subtract one leap year (366 days) from 856 days, leaving us with 490 days. Then we subtract one non-leap year (365 days), leaving us with 125 days.

Adding 1923 days involves calculating the number of complete years and extra days within those years. 

1923 days is approximately 5 years and 173 days (since 1923 / 365 ≈ 5.268, meaning 5 years plus some extra days). Given that 1997-08-19 plus 5 years would be 1997-08-19 + 5 years = 2002-08-19. Adding the remaining 173 days to 2002-08-19 requires us to break down the days into months.

Starting from August 19:
- August has 11 days left after August 19th (to the end of August), so we have 173 - 11 = 162 days remaining.
- September has 30 days, subtracting leaves us with 162 - 30 = 132 days.
- October has 31 days, subtracting leaves us with 132 - 31 = 101 days.

From December 31st, 1997 to December 31st, 1998 is 366 days because 1997 is not a leap year but 1998 is part of a leap year cycle (every 4 years), so 1996 was a leap year.

Hannah was born on May 26, 2012 and Henry was born on July 20, 2016.

To find the difference in days:
1. Calculate the number of days from May 26, 2012 to May 26, 2016. This period spans 4 full years, so we must consider leap years within this span. From 2012 to 2016, 2012 and 2016 are leap years. A common year has 365 days, and a leap year has 366 days.
   - Leap years: 2012 (366 days)
   - Common years: 2013 and 2014 (365 days each)
   - Leap year: 2016 (up to May 26) - Days from Jan 1 to May 26 in a non-leap year = 31 (Jan) + 28 (Feb) + 31 (Mar) + 30 (Apr) + 26 (May) = 146 days

   Total days from May 26, 2012 to May 26, 2016 = 366 (2012) + 365 (2013) + 365 (2014) + 146 (2016 up to May 26) = 1242 days

2. Now, calculate the number of days from May 26, 2016 to July 20, 2016.
   - Days remaining in May after May 26 = 31 - 26 = 5 days
   - Days in June = 30 days
   - Days from July 1 to July 20 = 20 days

   Total days from May 26, 2016 to July 20, 2016 = 5 + 30 + 20 = 55 days

Finally, add the days from both periods to get the total difference in days: 1242 + 55 = 1297"

Since there are 60 seconds in a minute, 159 seconds is 2 minutes and 39 seconds. And since there are 60 minutes in an hour, 114 minutes is 1 hour and 54 minutes. So, the total workout duration is 54 hours + 1 hour + 54 minutes + 2 minutes + 39 seconds = 55 hours, 56 minutes, and 39 seconds.

Next, we add the break time to the first leg of the journey:
1 hour, 58 minutes and 30 seconds + 20 hours, 4 minutes and 25 seconds = 22 hours, 1 minute and 55 seconds.

Then, we add the second leg of the journey to the sum:
22 hours, 1 minute and 55 seconds + 10 hours, 32 minutes and 48 seconds = 32 hours, 34 minutes and 43 seconds.

Now, we start from the departure time of 07:57 (or 07:57:00) and add the total travel time to find the arrival time:
07:57:00 + 32 hours, 34 minutes and 43 seconds.

Since 32 hours is equivalent to 1 day and 8 hours, adding 32 hours to the departure time results in 07:57:00 the next day. Then adding the remaining 8 hours, 34 minutes, and 43 seconds gives us:
07:57:00 + 8 hours, 34 minutes and 43 seconds = 16:31:43 (next day).

Calculate the difference in seconds:

From 11:40:07 to 23:06:01 is 11 hours and 25 minutes and 54 seconds.
11 hours = 11 * 3600 = 39600 seconds
25 minutes = 25 * 60 = 1500 seconds
54 seconds = 54 seconds

Total time in seconds = 3600 + 39600 + 1500 + 54 = 44754 seconds.

Convert seconds to hours, minutes, and seconds:
44754 seconds / 3600 = 12 hours and 154 seconds remaining.

Minutes: 44 + 27 = 71 minutes (which is 1 hour and 11 minutes)
Seconds: 55 + 42 = 97 seconds (which is 1 minute and 37 seconds)

First, let's calculate the difference in seconds:
- From 22:07:39 to 24:00:00 (midnight): 24:00:00 - 22:07:39 = 1 hour 52 minutes and 21 seconds = 60*60 + 52*60 + 21 = 3600 + 3120 + 21 = 6741 seconds.
- From 00:00:00 to 05:09:17: 5 hours 9 minutes and 17 seconds = 5*3600 + 9*60 + 17 = 18000 + 540 + 17 = 18557 seconds.
- Total time in seconds: 6741 + 18557 = 25398 seconds.

- Hours: 25398 / 3600 = 7 hours (with a remainder).
- Minutes: Remaining seconds after accounting for hours = 25398 - (7 * 3600) = 25398 - 25200 = 198 seconds. 198 / 60 = 3 minutes (with a remainder).

- Minutes: 53 / 2 = 26.5 minutes, which is 26 minutes and 0.5 * 60 = 30 seconds
- Seconds: 28 / 2 = 14 seconds

So, backing up one phone takes 2 hours, 26 minutes, and 30 seconds plus 14 seconds, which is still 2 hours, 26 minutes, and 30 seconds.

Next, we calculate the total time for backing up 8 phones by multiplying the time for one phone by 8:
- Hours: 2 * 8 = 16 hours
- Minutes: 26 * 8 = 208 minutes, which is 3 hours and 28 minutes (since 208 / 60 = 3 with a remainder of 28)
- Seconds: 30 * 8 = 240 seconds, which is 4 minutes (since 240 / 60 = 4)

Combining the results:
- Total hours: 16 + 3 = 19 hours
