","To determine the next year after 2024 when Purim will be celebrated, we need to look at the information provided in the table about the date of Purim.

1. The table shows that Purim is celebrated on the 14th day of Adar, or the 15th in Jerusalem and other ancient walled cities.
2. The dates for Purim are given for several years, including 2021, 2022, 2023, and 2024.
3. For 2024, Purim is scheduled from sunset on March 23 to nightfall on March 24, 2024.

Since the information provided does not give any indication that the date of Purim changes based on leap years or other factors, and since it is an annual celebration, we can conclude that the next celebration of Purim after 2024 will be in 2025.

Final Answer: The next celebration of Purim after 2024 will occur in 2025."

","To determine the next orbital period of Neptune starting from the time of its last perihelion, we need to consider the information provided about its orbital period and the specific date of its last perihelion.

1. **Orbital Period**: The table states that Neptune's orbital period is 164.8 years or 60,195 Earth days or 89,666 Neptunian solar days.

2. **Time of Perihelion**: The table provides the exact date of the last perihelion: 2042-Sep-04.

3. **Next Perihelion Calculation**:
   - To find the next perihelion, we add the orbital period (164.8 years) to the last perihelion date.
   - Starting from 2042-Sep-04, adding 164.8 years would bring us to 2206.

Therefore, the next orbital period will begin in the year 2206.

","To determine the age at which an individual can both serve and be deployed in the Australian Defence Force, we need to look at the information provided in the ""Personnel"" section of the table.

1. First, let's identify the relevant ages:
   - Military age to serve: 17 years old
   - Military age to deploy: 18 years old
   - Military age for special forces deployment: 19 years old

2. Since the question asks for the age to both serve and be deployed, we need to find the minimum age that satisfies both conditions.

3. From the information given, an individual must be 17 years old to serve and 18 years old to be deployed.

4. Therefore, the age at which one can both serve and be deployed would be the older of these two ages, which is 18 years old.

Final Answer: An Australian must be 18 years old to both serve and be deployed in the Australian Defence Force."

","To determine the age at which an individual can first be selected, serve, be deployed, and be eligible for selective service in the Australian Defence Force, we need to look at the provided information for each of these stages:

1. **Selection**: The table states that the military age for selection is 16.5 years.
2. **Service**: The table indicates that the minimum age to serve is 17 years.
3. **Deployment**: The table specifies that the minimum age to deploy is 18 years.
4. **Selective Service**: The table notes that conscription is no longer in place and provides the age for special forces deployment as 19 years, but this is not applicable to general service.

Given these points, the correct ages are:
- Selected: 16.5 years
- Serve: 17 years
- Deploy: 18 years
- Selective service: Not applicable due to conscription being abolished

The question asks for the age at which one can be selected, serve, be deployed, and be eligible for selective service. Since conscription is no longer applicable, we cannot provide an age for selective service eligibility.

Therefore, the final answer is:
Final Answer: An individual can be selected at 16.5 years, serve at 17 years, and be deployed at 18 years, but there is no longer an age for selective service eligibility in the Australian Defence Force."

","To determine which year between 2021 and 2024 Sukkot occurs latest, we need to look at the dates provided for each year.

1. **2021**: 
   - Begins: Sunset, 20 September
   - Ends: Nightfall, 27 September (28 September outside of Israel)

2. **2022**: 
   - Begins: Sunset, 9 October
   - Ends: Nightfall, 16 October (17 October outside of Israel)

3. **2023**: 
   - Begins: Sunset, 29 September
   - Ends: Nightfall, 6 October (7 October outside of Israel)

4. **2024**: 
   - Begins: Sunset, 16 October
   - Ends: Nightfall, 23 October (24 October outside of Israel)

Now, let's compare the starting dates:
- 2021: 20 September
- 2022: 9 October
- 2023: 29 September
- 2024: 16 October

The latest starting date among these years is 16 October in 2024.

Since Sukkot lasts for seven days, the ending date will also be later for the year that starts later. Therefore, Sukkot in 2024 will end on 23 October, which is later than the ending dates of 2021, 2022, and 2023.

Thus, Sukkot occurs latest in the year 2024.

Commonwealth Games
['Gold medal - first place | 2010 Delhi | Team', 'Gold medal - first place | 2014 Glasgow | Team']

","To determine the year when Chris Ciriello won the most overall gold medals, we need to analyze his achievements listed in the table.

1. **Olympic Games**: No gold medals mentioned.
2. **World Cup**: 
   - 2014: Gold medal
3. **Champions Trophy**:
   - 2010: Gold medal
   - 2012: Gold medal
   - 2014: Bronze medal (not counted as gold)
4. **Commonwealth Games**:
   - 2010: Gold medal
   - 2014: Gold medal

Now, let's count the gold medals per year:
- 2010: 2 gold medals (Champions Trophy and Commonwealth Games)
- 2012: 1 gold medal (Champions Trophy)
- 2014: 2 gold medals (World Cup and Commonwealth Games)

From this analysis, both 2010 and 2014 saw Ciriello winning 2 gold medals each. However, since the question asks for the ""most"" overall gold medals, we can consider that 2010 and 2014 are tied for the highest number of gold medals.

Since the question does not specify a single year if there's a tie, we can state that 2010 and 2014 are the years with the most overall gold medals.

Final Answer: Ciriello won the most overall gold medals in 2010 and 2014."

Part of the | 2004 Atlantic hurricane season

","To determine how many days Hurricane Gaston was over the water, we need to consider the dates it formed and dissipated.

1. The hurricane formed on August 27, 2004.
2. It dissipated on September 3, 2004.

Now, let's count the days from August 27 to September 3:

- August 27 to August 31: 5 days
- September 1 to September 3: 3 days

Adding these together: 5 + 3 = 8 days

However, since the hurricane dissipated on September 3, it would not have been fully over the water on that day. Therefore, we should count only the days up to the day before it dissipated.

So, the calculation should be:

- August 27 to August 31: 5 days
- September 1 to September 2: 2 days

Adding these together: 5 + 2 = 7 days

Therefore, the hurricane was over the water for 7 days.

Final Answer: Hurricane Gaston was over the water for 7 days."

3. The launch date is provided as:
   - Launch date: 14 March 2016, 09:31 UTC

4. Since the question asks for the number of years ExoMars was launched, it seems there might be a misunderstanding. Typically, spacecraft are not ""launched"" for a certain number of years; they are operational for a certain number of years after launch.

5. Given the options and the data available, the most relevant piece of information is the planned mission duration.

Now, let's calculate the duration:

1. Convert the dates to a common format for easier calculation:
   - Start Date: 22/02/1991
   - End Date: 01/12/2007

2. Calculate the difference between these two dates:
   - From 22 February 1991 to 31 December 2007 (inclusive of both dates)

3. Perform the calculation:
   - From 22 February 1991 to 31 December 2007 is 16 years and 10 months.

4. Since we are asked for the duration in years, we can round down to the nearest whole year:
   - 16 years

Therefore, Sanath Jayasuriya played for his national team for 16 years.

Unfortunately, the table does not provide specific information about I-176. We only know that I-179 was laid down on 21 August 1941 and launched on 16 July 1942. Without more information about I-176, we cannot determine its exact launch date.

Step 3: Finding the sinking date of I-176
Again, the table does not provide any information about when I-176 was sunk.

Step 4: Calculating the difference
Since we don't have the required information for either the launch or sinking dates of I-176, we cannot perform this calculation.

Final Answer: The provided information is insufficient to determine the number of days between the launch and sinking of the sister ship I-176."

","To determine how many days before D-Day the I-179 was sunk, we need to follow these steps:

1. Identify the date of D-Day.
2. Find the date when the I-179 was sunk.
3. Calculate the difference between these two dates.

Step 1: The date of D-Day is known to be June 6, 1944.

Step 2: From the ""History"" section, we can see that the I-179 was sunk on 14 July 1943.

Step 3: Now we need to calculate the difference between these two dates:
- From July 14, 1943, to June 6, 1944

Let's break this down:
- From July 14, 1943, to December 31, 1943: 5 months
- From January 1, 1944, to May 31, 1944: 5 months
- From June 1, 1944, to June 6, 1944: 6 days

Adding these up:
5 + 5 + 6 = 16 months and 6 days

However, since we're counting the days before D-Day, we need to exclude the full months and only count the days:
- 16 months = 480 days (assuming an average month has about 30 days)
- Adding 6 days gives us 486 days

Therefore, the I-179 was sunk approximately 486 days before D-Day.

Final Answer: The I-179 was sunk approximately 486 days before D-Day."

","To determine how many months after being ordered HMS Victory was laid down, we need to calculate the time difference between the order date and the laying down date.

1. The order date is given as 14 July 1758.
2. The laying down date is given as 23 July 1759.

Now, let's calculate the time difference:

- Full year from 1 July 1758 to 30 June 1759: 12 months
- From 1 July 1759 to 23 July 1759: 22 days

Adding these together:

","To determine how many months after being ordered the Maori was laid down, we need to follow these steps:

1. Identify the order date from the table.
2. Identify the laying down date from the table.
3. Calculate the difference between these two dates.

Step 1: The order date for the Maori is given as 10 March 1936.

Step 2: The laying down date for the Maori is given as 6 July 1936.

Step 3: Now we calculate the time difference:
- From 10 March to 31 March = 21 days
- April = 30 days
- May = 31 days
- June = 30 days
- 6 July = 6 days

Adding these up: 21 + 30 + 31 + 30 + 6 = 118 days

Since we need the answer in months, we convert 118 days to months. There are approximately 30.44 days in a month, so:

118 days ÷ 30.44 ≈ 3.87 months

Rounding to the nearest whole number, this is approximately 4 months.

Therefore, the Maori was laid down about 4 months after being ordered.

","To determine how many months after launch the Mars orbiter insertion occurred for ExoMars, we need to follow these steps:

1. Identify the launch date:
   - Launch date: 14 March 2016, 09:31 UTC

2. Identify the orbital insertion date:
   - Orbital insertion: 19 October 2016, 15:24 UTC

3. Calculate the difference in time between these two dates:
   - From 14 March to 19 October
   - We can break this down month by month:
     - March has 16 remaining days (from 14 to 31)
     - April, May, June, July, August, September each have 30 or 31 days
     - October has 19 days (from 1 to 19)

4. Sum up the days:
   - March: 16 days
   - April: 30 days
   - May: 31 days
   - June: 30 days
   - July: 31 days
   - August: 31 days
   - September: 30 days
   - October: 19 days
   - Total: 16 + 30 + 31 + 30 + 31 + 31 + 30 + 19 = 228 days

5. Convert days to months:
   - There are approximately 30.44 days in a month
   - 228 days ÷ 30.44 ≈ 7.47 months

Therefore, the Mars orbiter insertion occurred approximately 7.47 months after launch.

Final Answer: The Mars orbiter insertion for ExoMars occurred about 7.5 months after launch."

* Up to date as of July 2011.

","To determine how many months after turning 28 Kaiō Hiroyuki achieved Ōzeki, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate Kaiō Hiroyuki's age when he became Ōzeki.
2. Determine his age in months at that time.
3. Subtract his age in months when he turned 28 from this value.

Step 1: Kaiō Hiroyuki became Ōzeki in September 2000. He was born on July 24, 1972. So, he was approximately 28 years old when he reached this rank.

Step 2: To find out how many months he was when he became Ōzeki:
- From July 24, 1972, to July 24, 2000, is exactly 28 years.
- 28 years * 12 months/year = 336 months

Step 3: Calculate how many months he was when he turned 28:
- He was born on July 24, 1972, so he turned 28 on July 24, 1972 + 28 years = July 24, 1972 + 336 months = July 24, 1972 + 28 years = July 24, 1972 + 336 months = July 24, 1972 + 28 years = July 24, 1972 + 336 months.
- Therefore, he was 336 months old when he became Ōzeki.

Since he turned 28 exactly 336 months before becoming Ōzeki, the difference is 0 months.

","To determine how many months ago the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) were founded, we need to follow these steps:

1. Identify the founding date:
   - The table states: ""Founded: 26 May 1948""

2. Calculate the time elapsed from the founding date to the current date (December 2022):
   - From May 26, 1948, to May 26, 1973, is exactly 25 years.
   - From May 26, 1973, to December 2022 is 48 years and 7 months.

3. Convert the total years and months into just months:
   - 48 years * 12 months/year = 576 months
   - Adding the remaining 7 months gives us 583 months.

4. Verify if there's any simpler way to express this:
   - We can see that 25 years have already passed since the exact founding date, so we only need to count from 1973 to 2022.
   - 2022 - 1973 = 49 years
   - 49 years * 12 months/year = 588 months
   - Since we're asked for the number of months ago, we don't need to subtract any additional months.

Therefore, the Israel Defense Forces were founded approximately 588 months ago.

Final Answer: 588 months ago."

Step 1: The conscription length for the Army is given as 18 months.

Step 2: The conscription length for the Air Force is given as 22 months.

Step 3: To find out how many months longer the Air Force conscription is compared to the Army, we subtract the Army's conscription length from the Air Force's:
22 months (Air Force) - 18 months (Army) = 4 months

Therefore, the conscription for the Air Force is 4 months longer than for the Army.

Final Answer: The conscription for the Air Force is 4 months longer than for the Army."

","To determine how many months were left in the ExoMars mission as planned, we need to follow these steps:

1. Identify the planned mission duration.
2. Determine the current date based on the information provided.
3. Calculate the difference between the current date and the end of the planned mission duration.

Step 1: The planned mission duration is given as 7 years.

Step 2: The current date is provided as December 2022.

Step 3: To find out how many months were left in the mission:
- Convert the planned duration into months: 7 years * 12 months/year = 84 months
- Subtract the time already elapsed from the total planned duration:
  - Start date: March 14, 2016
  - Current date: December 31, 2022
  - Time elapsed: From March 14, 2016, to December 31, 2022

Let's break down the time elapsed:
- From March 14, 2016, to December 31, 2016: 9 months and 18 days
- From January 1, 2017, to December 31, 2022: 6 years = 72 months

Total elapsed time: 9 months + 72 months = 81 months

Now, subtract the elapsed time from the planned duration:
84 months - 81 months = 3 months

Therefore, there were 3 months left in the ExoMars mission as planned.

","To determine how many more months the ExoMars mission is planned to last, we need to compare the planned mission duration with the elapsed mission duration.

Step 1: Identify the planned mission duration.
The table states that the ""Planned"" mission duration is 7 years.

Step 2: Convert the planned mission duration into months.
7 years * 12 months/year = 84 months

Step 3: Identify the elapsed mission duration.
The table states that the ""Elapsed"" mission duration is 6 years, 3 months, and 18 days.

Step 4: Convert the elapsed mission duration into months.
6 years * 12 months/year = 72 months
3 months = 3 months
Total elapsed = 72 + 3 + (18 days as less than a month) ≈ 75 months

Step 5: Calculate the difference between planned and elapsed durations.
84 months (planned) - 75 months (elapsed) = 9 months

Therefore, the ExoMars mission is planned to last 9 more months.

Final Answer: The ExoMars mission is planned to last 9 more months."

4. Compare the durations:
   - Since Harold Macmillan had not yet started his term by the time the conflict ended, the comparison is between Winston Churchill's full term and the portion of Harold Macmillan's term that overlaps with the conflict.
   - Winston Churchill served 4 full years.
   - Harold Macmillan served from 1957 to 1960, which is 3 full years.

","To determine how many more years Valverde was with Puente Tocinos compared to Illes Balears–Banesto, we need to look at the durations of his stays with each team.

1. Puente Tocinos:
   - Years: 1989-1998
   - Duration: 1998 - 1989 = 9 years

2. Illes Balears–Banesto:
   - Years: 2005-2010
   - Duration: 2010 - 2005 = 5 years

3. Calculate the difference:
   - Difference: 9 years (Puente Tocinos) - 5 years (Illes Balears–Banesto) = 4 years

Therefore, Valverde was with Puente Tocinos 4 more years than he was with Illes Balears–Banesto.

","To determine how many years after FAT was GUNT an Anti-Libyan Chadian faction, we need to identify the start dates for both FAT and GUNT's involvement.

1. From the ""Belligerents"" section, we can see that:
   - FAT (Fédération des Armées Nationales Tchadiennes) operated from 1978 to 1979.
   - GUNT (Groupe de l'Armée Nationale Tchadienne) operated from 1986 to 1987.

2. The question asks about the period when GUNT was an Anti-Libyan Chadian faction, which is from 1986 to 1987.

3. We need to calculate how many years passed between the end of FAT's operation (1979) and the start of GUNT's operation as an Anti-Libyan Chadian faction (1986).

4. The difference between these two dates is:
   1986 - 1979 = 7 years

Therefore, GUNT became an Anti-Libyan Chadian faction 7 years after FAT ceased its operations.

","To determine how many years after the Australian Defence Force (ADF) was formed it took its current form, we need to follow these steps:

1. Identify when the ADF was founded:
   - From the table, the ADF was founded on 1 January 1901.

2. Identify when the ADF took its current form:
   - From the table, the ADF's current form is dated 9 February 1976.

3. Calculate the difference between these two dates:
   - From 1 January 1901 to 9 February 1976.

4. Break down the calculation:
   - From 1 January 1901 to 31 December 1975: 74 years
   - Adding the days from 1 January to 9 February in 1976: 9 days

5. Convert the days into years:
   - 9 days is approximately 0.0025 years (since there are 365 days in a year).

6. Add the years and the fraction of a year:
   - 74 years + 0.0025 years = 74.0025 years

Therefore, the ADF took 74 years and 9 days to reach its current form after being founded.

Final Answer: The Australian Defence Force took 74 years to reach its current form after being founded."

","To determine how many years after the order was placed the picture was taken, we need to follow these steps:

1. Identify when the HMS Astute was ordered.
2. Identify when the picture was taken.
3. Calculate the difference between these two dates.

Step 1: The HMS Astute was ordered on March 1997.

Step 2: The image mentioned in the question is the badge ""Astute Crest.jpg"". This image would have been created during or after the construction process, but no specific date is provided for the image creation.

Step 3: Since no specific date for the image is given, we can only use the commissioning date as a reference point. The HMS Astute was commissioned on 27 August 2010.

The difference between the order date (March 1997) and the commissioning date (August 2010):

- From March 1997 to August 2010 is approximately 13 years and 5 months.

Since the question asks for the number of years, we round this to 13 years.

Final Answer: The HMS Astute was ordered 13 years before the badge image was likely taken, assuming it was created around the time of commissioning."

","To determine how many years after the beginning of the Years of Lead the Bologna massacre occurred, we need to follow these steps:

1. Identify when the Years of Lead started:
   - The Years of Lead (Italy) started in ""Late 1968 - mid 1988"".

2. Determine the year of the Bologna massacre:
   - According to the table, the Bologna massacre occurred in 1980.

3. Calculate the difference between the start of the Years of Lead and the year of the Bologna massacre:
   - Start of Years of Lead: Late 1968 (we can use 1968 as a representative year)
   - Year of Bologna massacre: 1980
   - Difference: 1980 - 1968 = 12 years

Therefore, the Bologna massacre occurred 12 years after the beginning of the Years of Lead.

Casualties and losses
['500,000-1 million killed']

","To determine how many years after the beginning of the war the Sudanese Armed Forces reached their greatest strength, we need to follow these steps:

1. Identify the start date of the war.
2. Identify the peak strength of the Sudanese Armed Forces.
3. Calculate the difference between these two points in time.

Step 1: The start date of the First Sudanese Civil War was 18 August 1955.

Step 2: The peak strength of the Sudanese Armed Forces was 36,000, which occurred late 1971.

Step 3: Calculate the difference:
- From 18 August 1955 to 31 December 1971

Let's break this down further:
- From 18 August 1955 to 31 December 1955: 4 months and 13 days
- Full years from 1956 to 1971: 15 years
- From 1 January 1972 to 31 December 1971: 1 year

Adding these up:
4 months + 15 years + 1 year = 16 years and 4 months

Therefore, the Sudanese Armed Forces reached their greatest strength approximately 16 years after the beginning of the war.

","To determine how many years after the founding of the Republic of Korea Armed Forces the Vietnam War began, we need to follow these steps:

1. Identify the founding date of the Republic of Korea Armed Forces.
   - From the table, the founding date is 15 August 1948.

2. Identify the start date of the Vietnam War.
   - The table provides the start date as 1965.

3. Calculate the difference between these two dates.
   - Start date of Vietnam War: 1965
   - Founding date of ROK Armed Forces: 1948

   - The table states: ""Date: 2 December 1975 - present""
   - So, the insurgency began on 2 December 1975.

2. Identify when Russia stopped supporting the belligerents:
   - From the ""Belligerents"" section, we see that Russia supported Laos until 1989.
   - Specifically, it is stated: ""Supported by | Soviet Union (until 1989)""

3. Calculate the number of years between the start of the insurgency and Russia ceasing support:
   - Start date: 2 December 1975
   - End date: 1989 (assuming the end of support is at the end of 1989)

4. Perform the calculation:
   - 1989 - 1975 = 14 years

","To determine how many years are between Madan Lal's last Test and his ODI debut, we need to find the dates for both events and calculate the difference.

2. **Last Test Date**: The question states that Madan Lal's last Test was on 19 June 1986.

Now, let's calculate the difference between these two dates:

- From 13 July 1974 to 31 December 1974: \( 5 + 31 = 36 \) days
- From 1 January 1975 to 31 December 1985: \( 1985 - 1975 + 1 = 11 \) years
- From 1 January 1986 to 19 June 1986: \( 19 - 1 + 1 = 19 \) days

Adding these together:
\[ 36 \text{ days} + 11 \text{ years} + 19 \text{ days} \]

Since we are looking for the number of years, we can ignore the days as they do not affect the year count. Therefore, the total number of years is 11.

","To determine how many years before the commissioning of HMS Argyll it was laid down, we need to follow these steps:

1. Identify the commissioning date: The table shows that HMS Argyll was commissioned on 31 May 1991.
2. Identify the laying down date: The table states that HMS Argyll was laid down on 20 March 1987.
3. Calculate the difference in years between these two dates:
   - Commissioning date: 31 May 1991
   - Laying down date: 20 March 1987
4. To find the number of years, we can subtract the year of laying down from the year of commissioning:
   1991 - 1987 = 4 years

Therefore, HMS Argyll was laid down 4 years before its commissioning.

","To answer this question, we need to follow these steps:

1. Identify when the emergency ended.
2. Determine when Southern Rhodesia ceased being a belligerent.
3. Calculate the difference between these two dates.

Step 1: The emergency ended on 31 July 1960, according to the table.

Step 2: From the ""Belligerents"" section, we can see that Southern Rhodesia was a belligerent until 1953.

Step 3: We need to calculate how many years passed between 1953 and 1960:
1960 - 1953 = 7 years

However, we need to find out how many years before the end of the emergency Southern Rhodesia ceased being a belligerent. Since the emergency ended in 1960 and Southern Rhodesia stopped being a belligerent in 1953, we need to count the years from 1953 to 1960:
1960 - 1953 = 7 years

Therefore, Southern Rhodesia ceased being a belligerent 7 years before the end of the emergency.

","To determine how many years before the end of the war DR Sudan ended its support, we need to follow these steps:

1. Identify the end date of the war from the table.
2. Find when DR Sudan stopped supporting one of the belligerent factions.
3. Calculate the difference between these two dates.

Step 1: The end date of the war is given as 11 September 1987.

Step 2: From the ""Supported by"" section, we see that DR Sudan supported various factions until 1985. Specifically:
- DR Sudan supported FAT (1978-1985)
- DR Sudan supported FAN (1978-1985)
- DR Sudan supported FANT (1983-1985)

Step 3: We need to calculate the difference between 1987 (end of the war) and 1985 (end of DR Sudan's support).

1987 - 1985 = 2 years

Therefore, DR Sudan ended its support 2 years before the end of the war.

","To determine how many years Chiyonofuji Mitsugu competed, we need to find the difference between his debut year and the year he retired.

1. From the table, we can see that Chiyonofuji Mitsugu's debut was in September 1970.
2. He retired in May 1991.

Now, let's calculate the number of years:

1. From September 1970 to September 1991: This would be 21 years.
2. Since he retired in May 1991, which is before September, we subtract one year from the total.

Therefore, the calculation is:
21 years - 1 year = 20 years

Final Answer: Chiyonofuji Mitsugu competed for 20 years."

","To determine how many years Don Bradman played for the national side, we need to look at his Test debut and last Test dates.

1. Test debut: According to the table, Bradman's Test debut was on 30 November 1928 against England.
2. Last Test: The table shows his last Test was on 18 August 1948 against England.

Now, let's calculate the number of years between these two dates:
- Start year: 1928
- End year: 1948

To find the number of years, we subtract the start year from the end year:
1948 - 1928 = 20 years

However, since he played in both the debut year (1928) and the last year (1948), we need to include both years in our count. Therefore, we add 1 to the result:
20 + 1 = 21 years

Final Answer: Don Bradman played for the national side for 21 years."

How many years did Neo Hom support belligerents in the Insurgency in Laos?,26,proxy war,987,<num_years>,years,tail,"category

Insurgency in Laos
Date	2 December 1975 - present
Location	Southern Laos (royalists and rightists); Central and Northern Laos (Hmong rebels)
Status	Ongoing low-intensity conflict | 2007 Hmong-led coup attempt against the Lao government foiled; alleged plotters tried and exonerated in the U.S.
['Part of the Third Indochina War']

Belligerents
Laos | Lao People's Revolutionary Party | Supported by | Vietnam (from 1976) | North Vietnam (until 1976) | Soviet Union (until 1989)	Hmong insurgents | Supported by | Thailand (until 1990) | United States (until 1990) | Neo Hom (1981-2007) | Royalists | Lao National Liberation Front | Royal Lao Democratic Government (1982) | Supported by | Royal Lao Government in Exile | China (until 1988) | Cambodia | Democratic Kampuchea (until 1979) | Cambodia | Khmer Rouge | Cambodia | Party of Democratic Kampuchea (1981-1990) | Rightists | United Front for the Liberation of Laos | Supported by | Thailand (early to mid-1980s)

","To determine how many years Neo Hom supported belligerents in the Insurgency in Laos, we need to follow these steps:

1. Identify the period during which Neo Hom was listed as a supporter.
2. Compare this period with the overall duration of the insurgency.

Step 1: From the table, we can see that Neo Hom is listed under ""Supported by"" for the Hmong insurgents, with the period noted as ""1981-2007"".

Step 2: The table also provides information about the date range for the insurgency:
- Start date: 2 December 1975
- Current status: Ongoing low-intensity conflict (as of the current date, which we assume is December 2022)

However, for the purpose of answering the specific question about Neo Hom's support, we only need to focus on the period from 1981 to 2007.

Calculating the duration:
2007 - 1981 = 26 years

Therefore, Neo Hom supported belligerents in the Insurgency in Laos for 26 years.

1. From the International information section, we see:

2. Calculate the difference between these two dates:

3. The calculation is straightforward since both dates are on the same day (November 14 or 15):
   - 2013 - 1989 = 24 years

However, since he played on both the debut and last Test days, we need to count these as full years of play:
   - 24 years + 1 year (for the debut year) = 25 years

Therefore, Sachin Tendulkar played for the national side for 25 years.

","To determine how many years it took Jenson Button to win his second championship, we need to identify when he won his first championship and when he won his second championship. Then, we'll calculate the difference between these two years.

1. **Identify the year of his first championship:**
   - Jenson Button's Formula One World Championship career shows that he won 1 championship in 2009.
   
2. **Identify the year of his second championship:**
   - The Super GT GT500 Championship career indicates that he won 1 championship in 2018.

3. **Calculate the difference:**
   - 2018 (second championship) - 2009 (first championship) = 9 years

1. Identify the order date: January 1992
2. Identify the commissioning date: 20 September 1996
3. Calculate the difference between these two dates

Step 1: The order date is January 1992.
Step 2: The commissioning date is 20 September 1996.
Step 3: To calculate the difference:
   - From January 1992 to December 1992: 12 months
   - From January 1993 to December 1995: 3 years * 12 months/year = 36 months
   - From January 1996 to September 1996: 9 months

Adding these together:
12 + 36 + 9 = 57 months

To convert months into years:
57 months ÷ 12 months/year = 4.75 years

Since the question asks for the number of years, we can round this to the nearest whole number, which is 5 years.

Final Answer: It took 5 years for HMS Somerset to be commissioned after being ordered."

","To determine how many years it took to build HMS Somerset, we need to calculate the time between the order date and the laying down date.

1. Order date: January 1992
2. Laying down date: 12 October 1992

Now, let's calculate the difference:
- From January to October 1992: 10 months in 1992
- Since the ship was laid down in October 1992, we only count the full year of 1992

Therefore, the construction period was 1 full year from the order date to the laying down date.

Final Answer: It took 1 year to build HMS Somerset from the order date to the laying down date."

","To determine how long the Chadian Civil War lasted, we need to look at the start and end dates provided in the table.

Step 1: Identify the start date.
The table states that the Chadian Civil War began on ""1 November 1965"".

Step 2: Identify the end date.
The table indicates that the conflict ended with ""Signing of Lagos Accord and installation of Transitional Government of National Unity"" in ""November 1979"".

Step 3: Calculate the duration.
- Start year: 1965
- End year: 1979

To find the number of years, we subtract the start year from the end year:
1979 - 1965 = 14 years

However, since the war started in November 1965 and ended in November 1979, it means the war spanned exactly 14 full years.

Therefore, the Chadian Civil War lasted for 14 years.

Final Answer: The Chadian Civil War lasted for 14 years."

","To determine how many years the Defence Force lasted before its current form, we need to:
1. Identify when the Federal Defence Forces of Germany was founded.
2. Identify when it took its current form.
3. Calculate the difference between these two dates.

From the table:
1. The Federal Defence Forces of Germany was founded on 12 November 1955.
2. It took its current form on 3 October 1990.

Now, let's calculate the difference:
- From 1955 to 1989 (the year before its current form): 1989 - 1955 = 34 years
- From 1990 to 1990 (the exact date of change): 1 year

Adding these together: 34 + 1 = 35 years

Therefore, the Defence Force lasted 35 years before its current form.

","To determine how long the First Sudanese Civil War lasted, we need to look at the start and end dates provided in the table.

Step 1: Identify the start date.
The start date is given as 18 August 1955.

Step 2: Identify the end date.
The end date is given as 27 March 1972.

Step 3: Calculate the duration.
We can calculate the duration by subtracting the start year from the end year and adjusting for the specific months and days.

From 1955 to 1971, that's 16 full years.
From 1 January 1972 to 27 March 1972:
- January has 31 days, so from 1 to 31 is 31 days.
- February has 29 days in a leap year, which it was in 1972.
- March up to 27 is 27 days.

Adding these together:
16 years + 31 days (January) + 29 days (February) + 27 days (March) = 16 years, 3 months, and 27 days.

However, the table provides a more precise duration: ""16 years, 7 months, 1 week and 2 days.""

Final Answer: The First Sudanese Civil War lasted 16 years, 7 months, 1 week, and 2 days."

","To determine the number of years that elapsed between the laying down and the launching of the Tonnerre, we need to follow these steps:

1. Identify the dates for both events:
   - Laid down: 22 September 1794
   - Launched: 9 June 1808

2. Calculate the difference in years between these two dates:
   - From 22 September 1794 to 9 June 1808

3. Since the exact day and month don't match, we can simplify this to the full years:
   - From 1794 to 1808 is 14 years

Therefore, the number of years that elapsed between the laying down and the launching of the Tonnerre is 14 years.

","To determine how many years Adal was known as Birlik before changing its name in 2020, we need to follow these steps:

1. Identify when Adal was founded as Birlik.
2. Determine the year when Adal changed its name to Adal.
3. Calculate the duration between these two points in time.

Step 1: Adal was founded as Birlik on 26 April 2013.

Step 2: The table indicates that Adal changed its name to Adal on 5 November 2020.

Step 3: To calculate the duration:
   - Start date: 26 April 2013
   - End date: 5 November 2020

Let's break it down:
- From 26 April 2013 to 31 December 2013: 8 months and 5 days
- From 1 January 2014 to 4 November 2020: 7 years and 10 months

Adding these together:
- 8 months and 5 days + 7 years and 10 months = 8 years and 1 month and 5 days

Since we are asked for the number of years, we can round this to 8 years.

Therefore, Adal was known as Birlik for 8 years before changing its name in 2020.

","To answer this question, we need to determine the start dates of both the New Order and the National Vanguard, and then calculate how long the New Order had been fighting when the National Vanguard joined.

Step 1: Identify the start date of the New Order.
From the ""Commanders and leaders"" section, we see that the New Order started in 1957.

Step 2: Identify the start date of the National Vanguard.
From the ""Commanders and leaders"" section, we see that the National Vanguard started in 1960.

Step 3: Calculate the number of years the New Order had been fighting when the National Vanguard joined.
The National Vanguard joined in 1960, and the New Order started in 1957. Therefore, the calculation is:
1960 - 1957 = 3 years

So, the New Order had been fighting for 3 years when the National Vanguard joined.

Final Answer: The New Order had been fighting for 3 years when the National Vanguard joined."

1. The question asks about HMS Astute, but the table only provides information about HMS Somerset.

2. HMS Somerset was commissioned on 20 September 1996 and is currently in active service.

3. The question seems to be based on incorrect information, as there is no mention of HMS Astute in the given data.

4. Since we have accurate information about HMS Somerset, we can calculate its service years.

5. As of December 2022, HMS Somerset has been in service for:
   2022 - 1996 = 26 years

Therefore, based on the information provided in the table, HMS Somerset has been in service with the UK Navy for 26 years.

","To answer this question, we need to determine the duration for which each organization existed and then calculate the difference.

Step 1: Determine the existence period of the Arab Socialist Ba'ath Party.
The table states that the party was founded on 7 April 1947. Since no end date is provided, we can assume it continues to exist up to the current date, which is December 2022.

Duration of the Arab Socialist Ba'ath Party:

Duration of the paramilitary wing:
From 2012 to 2018 = 2018 - 2012 = 6 years

Step 3: Calculate the difference in duration.
Difference = Duration of the Arab Socialist Ba'ath Party - Duration of the paramilitary wing
           = 75 years - 6 years
           = 69 years

","To answer this question, we need to determine the duration each group was a belligerent and then find the difference between these durations.

Step 1: Determine the duration for Neo Hom
- Neo Hom supported the Hmong insurgents from 1981 to 2007.
- Duration = 2007 - 1981 = 26 years

Step 2: Determine the duration for the Party of Democratic Kampuchea
- The Party of Democratic Kampuchea supported Cambodia from 1981 to 1990.
- Duration = 1990 - 1981 = 9 years

Step 3: Calculate the difference
- Difference = 26 years (Neo Hom) - 9 years (Party of Democratic Kampuchea) = 17 years

Final Answer: Neo Hom was a belligerent 17 years longer than the Party of Democratic Kampuchea."

","To determine how many years longer the Red Brigades were belligerents compared to Workers' Autonomy, we need to identify their respective timeframes from the information provided.

1. **Red Brigades**:
   - The Red Brigades (BR) are mentioned in the ""Belligerents"" section.
   - Their timeframe is given as ""1970-1988"".

2. **Workers' Autonomy (WO)**:
   - WO is also mentioned in the ""Belligerents"" section.
   - Their timeframe is given as ""1973-1979"".

Next, we calculate the duration of each group's involvement:

- **Red Brigades**:
  - From 1970 to 1988
  - Duration = 1988 - 1970 = 18 years

- **Workers' Autonomy**:
  - From 1973 to 1979
  - Duration = 1979 - 1973 = 6 years

Finally, we find the difference in their durations:

- Difference = Duration of Red Brigades - Duration of Workers' Autonomy
- Difference = 18 years - 6 years = 12 years

Therefore, the Red Brigades were belligerents for 12 years longer than Workers' Autonomy.

Final Answer: 12 years."

","To determine how many years Aminishiki Ryūji was involved in sumo before retiring, we need to find his debut year and his retirement year from the given information.

1. Debut: The table states that Aminishiki Ryūji's debut was in January, 1997.

- From January 1998 to December 1998: 1 year
- ...
- From January 2018 to December 2018: 1 year
- From January 2019 to July 2019: 0.5 years (since he retired in July)

Adding these up:

3. Calculate the difference between these two dates:
   - From September 1986 to May 1991 is exactly 4 years and 8 months.

4. Convert the months into years:
   - 8 months is approximately 8/12 = 0.67 years.

5. Add the full years and the fractional year:
   - 4 years + 0.67 years = 4.67 years.

Since the question asks for the number of years, we can round this to the nearest whole number if necessary, but the exact answer is 4.67 years.

Final Answer: There were 4.67 years between when HMS Argyll was ordered and commissioned."

","To determine how many years someone who is 8 years old would have to wait before serving in the Federal Defence Forces of Germany, we need to consider the military age requirement.

Step 1: Identify the military age.
From the table, we can see that the military age is 17.

Step 2: Calculate the difference between the military age and the current age.
The person is currently 8 years old, and the military age is 17. 
So, the difference is 17 - 8 = 9 years.

Step 3: Determine if conscription is still in effect.
While conscription was mentioned as being indefinitely suspended since July 2011, it's important to note that this information might be outdated. However, based on the data provided, conscription is not currently active.

Step 4: Consider voluntary service.
Even without conscription, individuals can still volunteer for service in the Bundeswehr once they meet the age requirement of 17.

Therefore, a person who is currently 8 years old would have to wait 9 years to potentially serve in the Federal Defence Forces of Germany, assuming conscription remains suspended and they decide to join voluntarily.

Final Answer: 9 years."

","To determine how old Ali Farag was when he won his first team gold at the World Team Championships, we need to follow these steps:

1. Identify when Ali Farag won his first team gold at the World Team Championships.
2. Calculate his age at that time.

Step 1: Identifying the first team gold win
From the ""World Team Championships"" section, we see:
- Gold medal - first place | 2017 Marseille | Team
- Gold medal - first place | 2019 Washington D.C. | Team

The first mention of a gold medal is for the 2017 event in Marseille.

Step 2: Calculating his age in 2017
We know from the ""Born"" row that Ali Farag was born on 22 April 1992.

Now, let's calculate his age in 2017:
- 2017 - 1992 = 25 years old
- Since his birthday (22 April) comes after 2017, he would have turned 25 in 2017 but not yet turned 26.

Therefore, Ali Farag was 25 years old when he won his first team gold at the World Team Championships in 2017.

","To determine how old Aminishiki Ryūji was when he achieved his highest rank, we need to follow these steps:

1. Identify when Aminishiki Ryūji's highest rank was achieved.
2. Determine his age on that specific date.

Step 1: From the Career section, we can see that Aminishiki Ryūji's highest rank was Sekiwake, which he reached in September 2007.

Step 2: We know from the Personal information section that Aminishiki Ryūji was born on October 3, 1978. To find out how old he was in September 2007, we calculate the difference between these dates.

Since September 2007 comes before his birthday in October 2007, we can subtract 1978 from 2007 and then adjust for the month:
2007 - 1978 = 29 years
However, since he had not yet had his birthday in September, we subtract one year:
29 - 1 = 28 years old

Therefore, Aminishiki Ryūji was 28 years old when he achieved his highest rank of Sekiwake in September 2007.

3. Calculate the difference between these two dates.

Step 1: His birth date is November 18, 1914.

Step 2: His debut date is January, 1934.

Step 3: To calculate his age:
- He was born in 1914 and debuted in 1934.
- The difference is 1934 - 1914 = 20 years.

However, since he debuted in January and was born in November, we need to account for the fact that he had not yet reached his 20th birthday at the time of his debut.

","To determine how old Sanath Jayasuriya was when he started playing for Bloomfield, we need to follow these steps:

1. Identify when Jayasuriya started playing for Bloomfield.

","To determine how old Sachin Tendulkar was when he joined Mumbai, we need to follow these steps:

1. Find the year Tendulkar joined Mumbai.
2. Determine Tendulkar's birth year.
3. Calculate the age difference between the joining year and birth year.

Step 1: From the ""Domestic team information"" section, we can see that Tendulkar played for Mumbai from 1988-2013.

Step 2: Tendulkar's birth year is given in the ""Personal information"" section as 1973.

Step 3: We need to find out which specific year within 1988-2013 he started playing for Mumbai. However, this exact year is not provided in the table. 

Since we don't have the exact start year but know it's somewhere between 1988 and 2013, let's use 1988 as the earliest possible start year for calculation purposes.

Age = 1988 - 1973 = 15 years old

Therefore, based on the available information, the earliest we can confidently state is that Sachin Tendulkar was 15 years old when he joined Mumbai.

Final Answer: Sachin Tendulkar was approximately 15 years old when he joined Mumbai."

","To determine how old Sachin Tendulkar was when he played his last one-day match, we need to follow these steps:

1. Identify the date of Tendulkar's last ODI match.
2. Calculate his age on that date.

Step 1: From the International information section, we can see that Tendulkar's last ODI was on 18 March 2012 against Pakistan.

Step 2: We need to calculate his age on 18 March 2012. According to the Personal information section, Sachin Tendulkar was born on 24 April 1973.

Since 18 March 2012 comes before his birthday in 2012 (which would be on 24 April 2012), we can calculate his age as follows:
- He was born in 1973
- In 2012, he would have turned 39 on his birthday (24 April 2012)
- Since 18 March 2012 is before his birthday, he had not yet turned 39

Therefore, Tendulkar was 38 years old when he played his last ODI match.

Final Answer: Sachin Tendulkar was 38 years old when he played his last one-day match."

   - 2017 Manchester: Gold medal (Mixed doubles)
   - 2016 Darwin: Bronze medal (Doubles)
   - 2017 Manchester: Bronze medal (Doubles)

4. Both 2016 and 2017 had mixed doubles gold medals, but we are specifically looking for a gold medal in the World Doubles Championships (not mixed doubles).

Since there is no separate entry for World Doubles Championships (just mixed doubles), we can conclude that the gold medals listed are from mixed doubles events.

Therefore, based on the information given, Paul Coll first won a gold medal in a mixed doubles event at the World Doubles Championships in 2016.

","To determine the year when Gagan Ajit Singh won the most gold medals in international competition, we need to analyze the information provided in the table regarding his achievements in various competitions.

1. **Asian Games**:

3. **Champions Challenge**:

From the above, we can see that he won gold medals in two separate years:
- 2001: Champions Challenge and Junior World Cup
- 2003: Asia Cup

Since both years have one gold medal each, we need to look at the context of the question, which asks for the year he won the most gold medals in international competition. Both years have the same number of gold medals.

Therefore, the answer is that Singh won the most gold medals (one each) in international competition in both 2001 and 2003.

Final Answer: Singh won the most gold medals in international competition in 2001 and 2003."

","To answer this question, we need to find the year when two specific conditions were met:
1. The annual exports of the Australian Defence Force were around $2 billion.
2. The active personnel reserve was at 59,095.

Let's break it down:

1. **Finding the Year for Annual Exports:**
   - The information about annual exports is given as ""Around | A$ | 2 billion (2018)"".
   - This means that in 2018, the annual exports were around $2 billion.

2. **Finding the Year for Active Personnel:**
   - The table provides the number of active personnel as 59,095 on ""30 June 2020"".

Since the question asks for a single year where both conditions are met, we need to check if these two events happened in the same year.

- The data for active personnel shows a specific count for June 2020.
- The data for annual exports shows a figure for 2018.

Given that these are different years and there is no overlapping information provided, we can conclude that there is no single year where both conditions are met simultaneously based on the given data.

**Final Answer:** There is no year in which the Australian Defence Force's annual exports totalled around $2 billion and the active personnel reserve was exactly 59,095, as these figures pertain to different years (2018 for exports and 2020 for personnel)."

","To determine the date of Thanksgiving in 2023, we need to understand that Thanksgiving in the United States is traditionally observed on the fourth Thursday of November.

Step 1: Identify the range of dates for November 2023.
- The first possible date for Thanksgiving in 2023 would be November 23 (the earliest it can fall).
- The latest possible date would be November 29 (the latest it can fall).

Step 2: Determine which Thursday falls within this range.
- November 23 is a Thursday.
- November 24 is a Friday.
- November 25 is a Saturday.
- November 26 is a Sunday.
- November 27 is a Monday.
- November 30 is a Thursday.

Step 3: Confirm that the fourth Thursday in November 2023 is November 23.
- The Thursdays in November 2023 are November 23, November 30.

Since November 23 is the only Thursday that fits the criteria of being the fourth Thursday, Thanksgiving in 2023 will be on November 23.

Final Answer: Thanksgiving in 2023 will be on November 23."

","To determine the date of Thanksgiving in 2024, we need to follow these steps:

1. Identify the relationship between Black Friday and Thanksgiving: Black Friday is observed on the day after Thanksgiving.
2. Find the Black Friday date for 2024 in the table: The table shows that Black Friday in 2024 falls on November 29.
3. Deduce the Thanksgiving date: Since Black Friday is the day after Thanksgiving, Thanksgiving must have been on November 28, 2024.

However, the table does not directly provide the Thanksgiving date for 2024. We can infer it based on the given Black Friday dates for subsequent years.

4. Notice the pattern in the Black Friday dates:
   - 2021: November 26
   - 2022: November 25
   - 2023: November 24
   - 2024: November 29

5. Observe the shift in dates: Each year, Thanksgiving seems to be one day earlier than the previous year.

6. Calculate the Thanksgiving date for 2024:
   - If Black Friday was November 29 in 2024, and it's one day after Thanksgiving, then Thanksgiving must have been November 28 in 2024.

Therefore, the correct date for Thanksgiving in 2024 is November 28.

Final Answer: Thanksgiving will be on November 28 in 2024."

","To determine in which year the Western and Eastern Easter dates were one week apart, other than in 2022, we need to compare the dates provided for each year and see if they fall exactly one week (7 days) apart.

Let's examine the dates:

- **2021**: 
  - Western: April 4
  - Eastern: May 2
  - Difference: 29 days

- **2022**: 
  - Western: April 17
  - Eastern: April 24

- **2023**: 
  - Western: April 9
  - Eastern: April 16
  - Difference: 7 days

- **2024**: 
  - Western: March 31
  - Eastern: May 5
  - Difference: 38 days

From this analysis, we can see that the years 2023 and 2022 both have a difference of 7 days between the Western and Eastern Easter dates. Since the question specifies ""other than in 2022,"" the answer is 2023.

","To determine the duration of the 1995 Atlantic hurricane season, we need to find the dates when the first and last systems formed or dissipated.

From the table:
- The first system formed on June 2, 1995.
- The last system dissipated on November 1, 1995.

Now, let's calculate the number of days between these two dates.

1. Calculate the number of days from June 2 to December 31, 1995:
   - June has 30 days, so from June 2 to June 30 is 29 days.
   - July, August, September, October, and November each have 31, 31, 30, 31, and 30 days respectively.
   - Sum of these months: 31 + 31 + 30 + 31 + 30 = 153 days.
   - Total for June 2 to December 31: 29 + 153 = 182 days.

2. Subtract one day because we don't count the start date (June 2) but include the end date (November 1):
   - 182 - 1 = 181 days.

Therefore, the 1995 Atlantic hurricane season lasted 181 days.

['Wüger Kreuzigung.jpg | A Stabat Mater depiction, 1868']

","To determine over how many years the Eastern and Western Good Friday dates have been 7 days apart, we need to compare the given dates for each year from 2021 to 2024.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **2021 Dates**:
   - Western: April 15
   - Eastern: April 30
   - Difference: 30 - 15 = 15 days

2. **2022 Dates**:
   - Western: April 15
   - Eastern: April 22
   - Difference: 22 - 15 = 7 days

3. **2023 Dates**:
   - Western: April 7
   - Eastern: April 14
   - Difference: 14 - 7 = 7 days

4. **2024 Dates**:
   - Western: March 29
   - Eastern: May 3
   - Difference: 3 + 31 + 29 - 29 = 35 days (since March has 31 days)

### Analysis:
- In 2022 and 2023, the difference was exactly 7 days.
- In 2021 and 2024, the difference was not 7 days.

Therefore, the Eastern and Western dates were 7 days apart in two out of the four years provided.

### Final Answer:
The Eastern and Western Good Friday dates have been 7 days apart over 2 years (2022 and 2023)."

","To determine over how many years the Western Easter date is in April, we need to examine the given dates for Western Easter:

- 2021: April 4
- 2022: April 17
- 2023: April 9
- 2024: March 31

From this information, we can see that Western Easter was in April for three out of these four years (2021, 2022, and 2023). However, 2024 is not in April, so we exclude it from our count.

Therefore, Western Easter was in April for 3 years.

","Let's think through this step by step:

1. The question asks about Bartali's time as an amateur rider.
2. We need to look at the ""Amateur team"" section of the table.
3. The table shows a single entry for the amateur period: 1931-1934.
4. This indicates that Bartali was an amateur from 1931 to 1934.
5. To calculate the number of years, we subtract the start year from the end year:
   1934 - 1931 = 3 years

Therefore, Gino Bartali was a part of the amateur team for 3 years.

","To determine the first Monday in November 2018, we need to follow these steps:

1. Identify the specific date of November 1, 2018.
2. Determine the day of the week for November 1, 2018.

November 1, 2018, was a Wednesday. Therefore, the first Monday in November would be one day before this, which is October 29, 2018.

The National Election Day is the Tuesday after the first Monday of November. So, if the first Monday is October 29, 2018, then the Tuesday after that would be November 6, 2018.

However, the question specifically asks for the first Monday in November 2018. Given that November 1, 2018, was a Wednesday, the first Monday in November 2018 would be November 5, 2018.

","To determine the minimum age required to join the British Armed Forces in 2021, we need to look at the information provided in the table under the ""Personnel"" section, specifically the ""Military age"" row.

Step 1: Locate the ""Military age"" row in the table.
The row states: ""Military age	16-17 | with parental consent | , 18 | without and to serve in combat""

Step 2: Interpret the information given.
- The age range is from 16 to 18 years old.
- There are two conditions:
  a) Age 16-17 with parental consent
  b) Age 18 without parental consent

Step 3: Determine the minimum age.
The minimum age that can be met without any additional conditions is 16, but this requires parental consent. Without parental consent, the minimum age is 18.

Therefore, the minimum age required to join the British Armed Forces in 2021 is 16, provided there is parental consent.

Final Answer: The minimum age required to join the British Armed Forces in 2021 is 16, with parental consent."

","To determine when the United Sabah Party (PBS) split from the Sabah People's United Front (BERJAYA), let's follow these steps:

1. Identify the relevant information in the table:
   - The table mentions ""Split from: Sabah People's United Front (BERJAYA)""

2. Look for any specific dates or years associated with this split:
   - There is no explicit date given for the split in the provided information

3. Consider if we can infer the split date:
   - PBS was founded on 5 March 1985
   - It's logical that it would have split from another party before its founding

4. Check for any indirect clues:
   - The table lists PBS's ideologies and political positions, which might suggest it formed independently of BERJAYA

5. Conclude based on available information:
   - While we don't have an exact year, the table strongly implies PBS split from BERJAYA before its own founding in 1985

Final Answer: The United Sabah Party (PBS) likely split from the Sabah People's United Front (BERJAYA) sometime before March 5, 1985, but the exact year is not specified in the given information."
