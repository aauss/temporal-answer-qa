First, let's calculate the number of days between March 15, 2020 and August 15, 2020:
- March has 31 days, so from March 15 to March 31 is 16 days.
- April has 30 days.

Adding these up: 16 + 30 + 31 + 30 + 31 + 15 = 153 days.

Next, we need to find the next free day by adding multiples of 16 to the initial 153 days:
- 153 + 16 = 169 days
- 169 + 16 = 185 days

Now, we need to convert 185 days into months and days starting from March 15, 2020:
- 185 days / 30.44 (approximate average days per month) ≈ 6.07 months, which means approximately 6 months and 7 days.

- From 13 Aug to 31 Aug: 18 days
- September has 30 days, so from 1 Sep to 30 Sep: 30 days
- From 1 Oct to 20 Oct: 20 days

Total days passed: 18 + 30 + 20 = 68 days.

Now, let's add 12 days to each paycheck cycle to find the next dates:
- After 68 days: 68 + 12 = 80 days
- After 80 days: 80 + 12 = 92 days
- After 92 days: 92 + 12 = 104 days

We need to break down 104 days into months and days:
- 104 days is equivalent to 3 months and 8 days (since 104 / 30 ≈ 3 with a remainder of 14).

Starting from 20 Nov, adding 3 months and 8 days:

14 (Dec) + 31 (Jan) + 29 (Feb) + 31 (Mar) + 30 (Apr) + 31 (May) + 29 (June) = 195 days.

Since the first free day was on 18 December, 2023, and every 18 days there is a free day, we need to find the next multiple of 18 after 195 days.

Dividing 195 by 18 gives us 10 remainder 15. This means that 195 days is 10 full cycles of 18 days plus 15 extra days. The next free day will be 18 days after the last full cycle, i.e., 195 + 18 = 213 days from 18 December, 2023.

Total days = 7 + 30 + 31 + 31 + 26 = 125 days

Since the first free day was on 24 May, 2016, we can determine the number of 13-day intervals within these 125 days:

Calculating the remaining days from July 15, 2011 to December 5, 2011:
- From July 15 to July 31: 16 days
- August: 31 days
- September: 30 days
- October: 31 days
- November: 30 days
- From December 1 to December 5: 5 days

Total days from July 15 to December 5: 16 + 31 + 30 + 31 + 30 + 5 = 133 days

Since 133 days is 8 full weeks and 7 days (133 / 7 = 19 weeks), we need to add 7 days to July 15, 2011, to account for the remaining days after 8 full weeks.

Jul 15 + 7 days = Jul 22, 2011

Now, we need to find the next multiple of 15 days after Jul 22, 2011. Adding 15 days to Jul 22, 2011, we get Aug 6, 2011.

Continuing this process:
- Aug 6 + 15 days = Aug 21, 2011
- Aug 21 + 15 days = Sep 5, 2011
- Sep 5 + 15 days = Sep 20, 2011
- Sep 20 + 15 days = Oct 5, 2011
- Oct 5 + 15 days = Oct 20, 2011
- Oct 20 + 15 days"

To find the next free day after today (14-07-1998), we need to calculate the difference in days between the first free day and today, then add 20 days to today’s date to get the next free day.

First, let's calculate the number of days between 21-04-1998 and 14-07-1998:
- From 21-04-1998 to 30-04-1998: 9 days
- May: 31 days
- June: 30 days
- From 1-07-1998 to 14-07-1998: 14 days

Total days = 9 + 31 + 30 + 14 = 84 days

Since the first free day was on 21-04-1998, we can find the next free day by adding 20 days to the current date. Today is 14-07-1998, so adding 20 days gives us:

From 21 Oct to 31 Oct, there are 10 days.

From 1 Dec to 13 Dec, there are 13 days.

So, the total number of days from 21 Oct to 14 Dec is 10 + 30 + 13 = 53 days. 

Next, we need to find the next multiple of 16 after 53. 53 divided by 16 is approximately 3.3125, so the next whole number is 4. Therefore, the next free day will be 4 * 16 = 64 days after 21 Oct.

So, we subtract 59 from 274 to get the exact day to add:
274 - 59 = 215 days.

Since we have already added 161 days to December 18, 2009, we can see that the 161st day after December 18 would fall on the 15th of the next month. 

Counting 161 days from December 18, 2009:
- 18 days in December
- 31 in January
- 28 in February
- 31 in March

1. Calculate the remaining days in December 2000:
   - December 27 to December 31: 31 - 27 + 1 = 5 days.

2. Subtract these 5 days from 466:
   - 466 - 5 = 461 days left to subtract.

3. Calculate the days in January 2000:
   - January has 31 days.
   - Subtract 31 days from 461:

4. Calculate the days in February 2000:
   - February 2000 has 29 days (leap year).
   - Subtract 29 days from 430:
     - 430 - 29 = 401 days left.

5. Calculate the days in March 2000:
   - March has 31 days.
   - Subtract 31 days from 401:
     - 401 - 31 = 370 days left.

6. Calculate the days in April 2000:
   - April has 30 days.
   - Subtract 30 days from 370:

First, we determine how many complete years fit into 420 days. Since one year typically has 365 days, we have:
\[ \text{Years} = \left\lfloor \frac{420}{365} \right\rfloor = 1 \]
So, there is 1 year, and the remaining days are:
\[ 420 - 365 = 55 \]

Next, we need to find out how many months fit into the remaining 55 days. We know that most months have 30 or 31 days. To simplify, we can assume an average month length of about 30.44 days (365 days / 12 months):
\[ \text{Months} = \left\lfloor \frac{55}{30.44} \right\rfloor = 1 \]
This gives us 1 month, and the remaining days are:
\[ 55 - 30 = 25 \]

Now, we subtract 1 year, 1 month, and 25 days from November 28, 2008. 

1. Subtracting 1 year from November 28, 2008, brings us to November 28, 2007.
2. Subtracting 1 month from November 28, 2007, brings us to October 28, 2007.
3. Subtracting 25 days from October 28, 2007, we count backwards:

   - October 28 - 1 day = October 27
   - October 27 - 1 day = October 26
   - ...
   - October 27 - 25 days = September 2

Therefore, the date 420 days before November 28, 2008, is September 2, 2007."", ""date"": ""09/02/2007""}"

From April to December, that’s 9 months, minus March and adding the whole of the following year: 9 + 12 = 21 months. 
In 21 months, there are 21 * 30 = 630 days, but we need to adjust for the actual number of days in each month.

1. Calculate the number of days in 17 weeks: 17 weeks * 7 days/week = 119 days.
2. Subtract 119 days from August 22, 2008. 
3. To do this, we can break down the subtraction into months and days.

- From August 22, 2008, subtract 14 days to get to the end of August: 22 - 14 = 8, so the date becomes August 8, 2008.
- Then, move back 105 days (since 119 - 14 = 105): Moving back through September, October, November, and December.
    - September has 30 days, so moving back 30 days from August 8 takes us to July 9.

To subtract days from a date, we start by subtracting the days from the day component of the date. Since 30 - 595 would result in a negative number, we need to adjust the month and year accordingly. 

First, let's break down 595 days into years and extra days:
- 595 / 365 ≈ 1.63 years, which means 1 year and 220 days (since 595 - 365 = 230, but we round down to the nearest whole year).

Now, we subtract 1 year from 2008, making it 2007. Then, we subtract the remaining 220 days from August 30, 2007.

To do this, we subtract 31 days (September), 30 days (October), 31 days (November), and 30 days (December), which totals 122 days. Subtracting 122 from 220 leaves us with 98 days to subtract from January 1, 2007.

First, we add the 42 weeks directly to the week number. July has 31 days, so after 28 days of July, we have 3 days left in July. This means the package would arrive on 31st of July if it were just 4 weeks. However, since we have 42 weeks, we move to the next steps:

- From 28 Jul to 31 Jul is 3 days into August.
- 42 weeks - 6 weeks (which covers the remaining part of the first 6 weeks of the following years) = 36 weeks.

Now, we add 36 weeks to the initial date:
- 36 weeks is equivalent to 9 months (since 36 / 4 = 9).
- Starting from July, adding 9 months lands us at April of the following year.

So, 28 Jul, 2019 + 36 weeks = 28 Apr, 2020.

- From October 1 to the end of October: 31 days
- From November 1 to the end of November: 30 days

Adding these up: 6 + 31 + 30 + 31 + 30 + 31 + 31 + 30 + 31 + 30 + 31 = 315 days.

First, let's subtract the weeks directly from the month and year:
- From 19 Feb, 1997, subtract 56 weeks (which is 7 * 8 = 56) to get to 19 Feb, 1996.

Now, we have 5 weeks left to subtract, which is 5 * 7 = 35 days.

Since one week has 7 days, 96 weeks have 96 * 7 = 672 days. Starting from April 29, 1997, we add 672 days to find the new date. 

To add days, we can break it down into months and days. April has 30 days, so adding 29 days to April 29 brings us to May 28. Then we subtract 1 day from June to account for the remaining days, bringing us to June 27.

Starting from March 31, 2001, adding 86 weeks means we move 86 * 7 = 602 days forward.

Now let's break down the calculation into months and days:

- From March 31, 2001 to December 31, 2001: 9 months (30+31+31+30+31+30+31+31+30=274 days)

- February 2002: 28 days (2002 is not a leap year)

- April 2002: 30 days
- May 2002: 31 days

- November 2002: 30 days
- December 2002: 31 days

Next, we add 630 days to the starting date of March 27, 2006. We can do this by breaking down the addition into more manageable steps:

1. First, let's see how many complete years and extra days 630 days represent. Since there are roughly 365 days in a year, 630 days is slightly more than one and a half years. Specifically, 630 / 365 ≈ 1.73 years, meaning it's about 1 year and 265 days.

2. Adding 1 year to March 27, 2006, brings us to March 27, 2007.

3. Now we need to add 265 days to March 27, 2007. We can break this down further:
   - From March 27 to December 31, 2007, there are 297 days (31 + 31 + 30 + 31 + 30 + 31 + 31 + 30 + 31 + 30 + 31).
   - After adding 297 days, we have 265 - 297 = -32 days left to add, which means we need to go back 32 days from December 31, 2007.
   - Going back 32 days from December 31, 2007, we reach November 10, 2007.

First, let's see how many full months fit into 203 days:
- April has 30 days, so after April 21, we have 30 - 21 = 9 days left in April.
- Subtracting those 9 days from 203 leaves us with 203 - 9 = 194 days.

Now, 194 days can be broken down into weeks and days:

So, we subtract 27 weeks from the start date, which brings us to the same day of the week but 27 weeks earlier. Since we started at the end of April, going back 27 weeks would put us in the last week of September.

Next, we need to calculate the date 550 days from May 18, 2011. To do this, we'll break down the calculation into months and days:

1. From May 18 to June 18 is 31 days.
2. From June 18 to July 18 is 30 days.
3. From July 18 to August 18 is 31 days.

6. From October 18 to November 18 is 30 days.
7. From November 18 to December 18 is 31 days.
8. From December 18 to January 18 is 31 days.
9. From January 18 to February 18 is 28 days (since 2011 is not a leap year).

Breaking down the calculation:
1. From 2018-11-20 to 2019-11-20 is exactly 365 days.
2. From 2019-11-20 to 2020-11-20 is another 365 days.
3. We then have 1168 - 365 - 365 = 438 days left to add.

Now, adding 438 days to 2020-11-20:
- November has 30 days, so from 2020-11-20 to 2020-11-30 is 10 days.
- Subtracting these 10 days from 438 leaves us with 428 days.
- December has 31 days, so from 2020-12-01 to 2020-12-31 is 31 days.

- February 2021 has 28 days (not a leap year), so from 2021-02-01 to 2021-02-28 is 28 days.
- Subtracting these 28 days from 366 leaves us with 338 days.

Since August has 31 days, we first see how many full months fit into 1511 days:
- From Aug 25 to end of August: 31 - 25 + 1 = 7 days remaining
- September has 30 days, so 1511 - 7 - 30 = 1474 days left
- October has 31 days, so 1474 - 31 = 1443 days left
- November has 30 days, so 1443 - 30 = 1413 days left
- December has 31 days, so 1413 - 31 = 1382 days left
- January of the next year has 31 days, so 1382 - 31 = 1351 days left
- February of the next year has 28 days (assuming it's not a leap year), so 1351 - 28 = 1323 days left

To find the date 986 days from now, we start from Apr-25, 2011. 

First, we calculate the number of complete years and remaining days:
- 986 days / 365 days/year ≈ 2.7027 years. This means 2 full years plus some extra days.

After 2 full years from Apr-25, 2011, we reach Apr-25, 2013. Next, we subtract the 2 full years from 986 days to find the remaining days: 986 - (2 * 365) = 256 days.

Now we need to add 256 days to Apr-25, 2013. We break down 256 days into months and extra days:
- 256 days / 30 days/month ≈ 8.5333 months, so 8 full months plus some extra days.

From Apr-25, 2013, adding 8 months leads us to Dec-25, 2013. Now we have 256 - (8 * 30) = 16 days left to add to Dec-25, 2013. Adding 16 days to Dec-25, 2013, we get Jan-10, 2014.

We can break down the addition into years, months, and days:

1. 1599 days is equivalent to 4 years and 275 days because 1599 / 365 = 4 with a remainder of 275.
2. Adding 4 years to 2008 gives us 2012.
3. We then add the remaining 275 days to August 16, 2012.

Breaking down the 275 days:
- From August 16 to December 31, 2012, there are 127 days (since August 16 to August 31 = 16 days, September = 30 days, October = 31 days, November = 30 days, December = 31 days).
- We have 275 - 127 = 148 days left to add to January 1, 2013.

Next, we need to find the date 1626 days from today, which is 2010-Sep-11.

To do this, we start by calculating how many days are left in September after 2010-Sep-11:
- There are 20 days remaining in September (from 11th to 30th).

Subtract these 20 days from 1626:
1626 - 20 = 1606 days.

Now, we move into October and continue subtracting days:
- October has 31 days, so we subtract 31 days from 1606:
1606 - 31 = 1575 days.

Next, we move into November and subtract its 30 days:
- Subtract 30 days from 1575:
1575 - 30 = 1545 days.

Next, we move into December and subtract its 31 days:
- Subtract 31 days from 1545:
1545 - 31 = 1514 days.

Next, we move into January of the following year and subtract its 31 days:
- Subtract 31 days from 1514:
1514 - 31 = 1483 days.

Next, we move into February of the following year. We need to check if it is a leap year or not. Since 2011 is not divisible by 4, it is not a leap year. February has 28 days:
- Subtract 28 days from 1483:
1483 - 28 = 1455 days.

Next, we move into March and subtract its 31 days:
- Subtract 31 days from 1455:
1455 - 31 = 1424 days.

Next, we move into April and subtract its 30 days:
- Subtract 30 days from 1424:
1424 - 30 = 1394 days.

Next, calculate the target date 1141 days from today. Starting from Nov-09, 2006, add 1141 days.

To find the final date, we need to handle the conversion through years, months, and days:

1. Determine the number of full years in 1141 days: 1141 / 365 ≈ 3 years (since each year has 365 days).

2. Calculate the remaining days after accounting for 3 years: 1141 - (3 * 365) = 146 days.

3. Determine the number of full months in the remaining 146 days: 146 / 30 ≈ 4 months (considering an average month length of 30 days for simplicity).

4. Calculate the remaining days after accounting for 4 months: 146 - (4 * 30) = 26 days.

So, 1141 days from Nov-09, 2006, is 3 years, 4 months, and 26 days later.

Adding 3 years to 2006 gives us 2009.

Adding 4 months to November brings us to March.

Now, adding 2 years to May 30, 2012, brings us to May 30, 2014.
- Next, we add the remaining 105 days to May 30, 2014.

Counting forward 105 days from May 30, 2014:
- From May 30 to June 30: 31 days
- July: 31 days
- August: 31 days
- September: 30 days
- October: 31 days
- November: 30 days
- December: 13 days (105 - (31 + 31 + 31 + 30 + 31 + 30) = 13)

So, May 30, 2014 + 105 days = December 13, 2014.

Therefore, the date 825 days from May 30, 2012, is December 13, 2014."", ""answer"": ""2014-12-13""}"

If the day after yesterday is August 25, 1997, then yesterday was August 24, 1997, and today is August 25, 1997. 

Next, we need to add 1419 days to today's date, which is August 25, 1997.

To do this, we can break down the calculation into manageable parts. We know that every year has 365 days, and a leap year has 366 days. Leap years occur every 4 years, except for years that are divisible by 100 but not by 400.

From 1997 to 2097, there are 100 years. In this period, there are 25 leap years (1996, 2000, 2004, ..., 2096), and 75 common years.

So, the total number of days from 1997 to 2097 is:
\[ 75 \times 365 + 25 \times 366 = 27375 + 9150 = 36525 \text{ days} \]

Since 1419 days is less than 36525 days, we don't need to worry about crossing any leap years or common years. We just need to add 1419 days directly to August 25, 1997.

Adding 1419 days to August 25, 1997, results in July 18, 2001.

First, let's break down the calculation into years and days:
- 1896 days is equivalent to 5 years and 161 days (since 1896 / 365 = 5 with a remainder of 161).

Starting from August 30, 2021, adding 5 years brings us to August 30, 2026. Then, we need to add 161 days to August 30, 2026.

To add 161 days to August 30, 2026:
- From August 30 to September 30 is 31 days.
- From September 30 to October 31 is 31 days.
- From October 31 to November 30 is 30 days.
- From November 30 to December 31 is 31 days.
- From December 31 to January 31, 2027 is 31 days.
- From January 31, 2027 to February 28, 2027 is 28 days (since 2027 is not a leap year).

Summing up these days: 31 + 31 + 30 + 31 + 31 + 28 = 161 days.

First, determine how many complete years fit into 1768 days:
1768 / 365 = 4 years and 328 days (since 1768 - 4 * 365 = 328).

Now, adding 4 years to 2023 gives us 2027. Then we add the remaining 328 days to March 26, 2027.

Counting 328 days from Mar 26, 2027:

- Remaining days: 328 - 274 = 54 days.

Adding 54 days to Jan 1, 2028:
- Jan: 31 days, Feb: 28 days (2028 is a leap year), Mar: 15 days (54 - 31 - 28 = 15).

   - August has 31 days.
   - September has 30 days.

2. From January 1, 2016, to December 31, 2016:
   - 2016 is a leap year, so February has 29 days.

First, let's break down 1268 days into years, months, and days:
- 1268 days is equivalent to 3 years, 3 months, and 10 days (since 1268 / 365 ≈ 3.472, which means 3 full years and the remainder is 1268 - 3*365 = 1268 - 1095 = 173 days. 173 days is approximately 5 months and 28 days, so it becomes 3 years, 5 months, and 28 - 20 (days in June) = 8 days).

Next, calculate the date 768 days from today (2017-07-21).

Since there are 365 days in a non-leap year, and July 21st is around the middle of the year, we can break down the calculation into parts:
- From July 21 to December 31 of the same year: 31 (July) + 31 (August) + 30 (September) + 31 (October) + 30 (November) + 31 (December) - 21 (already counted in July) = 142 days.
- Remaining days: 768 - 142 = 626 days.

Now, moving to the next year:
- 365 days in a non-leap year: 626 - 365 = 261 days.

For the third year:
- Moving to January: 31 days (January) - 261 = -230, so we move back to the previous year.

Since we have negative days, we subtract from the start of the year:
- 365 - 230 = 135 days, which means we are 135 days into the year.

Finally, counting 135 days from January 1:
- January: 31 days

- March: 31 days

First, we calculate the date 1971 days from December 30, 2016. We start by finding how many full years are covered by 1971 days:

1971 days / 365 days/year ≈ 5.4 years, so there are 5 full years.

Adding 5 years to December 30, 2016, brings us to December 30, 2021.

Next, we need to account for the remaining days:
1971 days - (5 * 365 days) = 1971 - 1825 = 146 days.

Now, we add these 146 days to December 30, 2021. 

December 30, 2021 + 146 days:
- January has 31 days, so 146 - 31 = 115 days remaining.
- February has 28 days (assuming it's not a leap year), so 115 - 28 = 87 days remaining.
- March has 31 days, so 87 - 31 = 56 days remaining.
- April has 30 days, so 56 - 30 = 26 days remaining.

Therefore, adding 26 days to April 30, 2022, we get May 26, 2022.

First, let's break down the calculation:

1. Calculate the number of full years and remaining days:
   - 856 days / 365 days/year ≈ 2.347 years
   - This means there are 2 full years and approximately 0.347 * 365 days ≈ 126 days left over.

2. Add the 2 full years to 2004-05-28:
   - 2004 + 2 = 2006

3. Add the remaining 126 days to May 28, 2006:
   - From May 28 to June 28 is 30 days.
   - From June 28 to July 28 is 30 days.
   - From July 28 to August 28 is 31 days.
   - From August 28 to September 28 is 31 days.
   - From September 28 to October 28 is 30 days.

1. We add 817 days directly to May 14, 2006.

Since 817 days is more than a year, we can break it down:
- 365 days make one full year.
- 817 - 365 = 452 days remaining after the first year.

Next, we add 452 days to May 14, 2007:
- From May 14 to December 31, 2007: 24 days (May has 31 days, so 31 - 14 + 1 = 18 days in May, plus all of June, July, August, September, October, November, and December).
- Remaining days: 452 - 24 = 428 days.
- From January 1, 2008 to December 31, 2008: 365 days.
- Remaining days: 428 - 365 = 63 days.

Next, we need to find the date 1521 days from today (Mar-15, 2008). To do this, we add 1521 days to Mar-15, 2008.

Breaking down the calculation:
1. Add 365 days to reach the end of the first year: Mar-15, 2008 + 365 days = Mar-15, 2009.
2. Add another 365 days to reach the end of the second year: Mar-15, 2009 + 365 days = Mar-15, 2010.
3. Add another 365 days to reach the end of the third year: Mar-15, 2010 + 365 days = Mar-15, 2011.

- Adding 2 years to 2000 gives us 2002.
- Adding 39 days to 2002-04-28:

Next, we add 84 days to Oct-11, 2000. Since October has 31 days, we start by adding the remaining days of October:
- Days left in October after Oct-11: 31 - 11 = 20 days.

So, adding 20 days to Oct-11 brings us to Nov-10. We have 84 - 20 = 64 days left to add.

Now, November has 30 days, so we add the remaining days of November:
- Days left in November after Nov-10: 30 - 1 = 29 days.

Adding 29 days to Nov-10 brings us to Dec-9. We have 64 - 29 = 35 days left to add.

December has 31 days, so we add the remaining days of December:
- Days left in December after Dec-9: 31 - 9 = 22 days.

Adding 22 days to Dec-9 brings us to Dec-21. We have 35 - 22 = 13 days left to add.

Finally, January has 31 days, so we add the remaining 13 days to Jan-1:

To find the date 89 days from now, we start from today's date, 2017-03-11, and add 89 days.

November has 30 days. After accounting for November, we have 77 - 30 = 47 days left.

December has 31 days. After accounting for December, we have 47 - 31 = 16 days left.

We need to determine the date 88 days from today (January 21, 2013).

First, we calculate the number of days remaining in January 2013:
- January has 31 days, so from January 21 to January 31 is 10 days.

Then, we subtract those 10 days from 88 days:
- 88 - 10 = 78 days remaining after January.

Next, we calculate how many full months (in terms of 30 or 31 days) fit into 78 days:
- 78 / 31 = 2 full months (with 78 - (31 * 2) = 16 days left over).

So, 2 full months from February 2013 (which is 28 days in a common year) brings us to April 30, 2013.

Finally, we add the remaining 16 days to April 30, 2013:
- Adding 16 days to April 30, 2013, brings us to May 16, 2013.

Since Chris was born on 2007-Nov-05, we add 838 days to that date. To do this, we break down the calculation into parts: 

1. From Nov-05 to Dec-28: 
   - November has 30 days, so from Nov-05 to Nov-30 is 25 days.
   - December has 28 days, so from Dec-01 to Dec-28 is 28 days.
   - Total days from Nov-05 to Dec-28: 25 + 28 = 53 days.

2. Remaining days after accounting for Dec-28:
   - 838 - 53 = 785 days left to add.

3. Adding 785 days starting from Jan-01, 2008:
   - January has 31 days, February has 28 days (since 2008 is a leap year), March has 31 days, April has 30 days, May has 31 days, June has 30 days, July has 31 days, August has 31 days, September has 30 days, October has 31 days, and November has 30 days.
   - After adding up these days: 31 + 28 + 31 + 30 + 31 + 30 + 31 + 31 + 30 + 31 + 30 = 334 days.
   - Remaining days after accounting for November: 785 - 334 = 451 days.
   - December has 451 days, so we need to go back to the previous year, 2007, and add 451 days to Nov-30, 2007.
   - 451 - 30 = 421 days into December 2007.
   - So, Chris was 838 days old on 2008-Apr-29.

Now, we need to calculate how many days Christina had been alive on this date. Christina was born on 2014-Nov-13. From Nov-13 to Dec-21, we have:
- November has 30 days, so from Nov-13 to Nov-30 is 30 - 13 + 1 = 18 days.

   Total days from beginning of the year to August 3: 31 + 28 + 31 + 30 + 31 + 30 + 31 + 3 = 225 days

3. The difference in years is 1999 - 2000 = -1 year, which means we need to subtract 365 days for the full year:

4. Adding up all the days:
   273 (from April 22 to end of the year) + 225 (from beginning of the year to August 3) - 365 (subtracting the full year) = 33 days

Each regular year has 365 days, and each leap year has 366 days. So, the total number of days is calculated as follows:
- Regular years: (6 - 2) * 365 = 4 * 365 = 1460 days
- Leap years: 2 * 366 = 732 days

Adding the days for the partial year:
- Total days for the year 2010 up to August 24: 365 - (31 + 28 + 31 + 30 + 31 + 30 + 31 - 24) = 365 - 198 = 167 days

So, the total age in days is:

- From 1989 to 1999, there are 10 years.
- In those 10 years, there are 2 leap years (1992 and 1996), so we have 2 extra days.
- From October 24 to July 20, we need to account for the remaining months and days.

Let's calculate the days for each year:
- For the first year (1990), from October 24 to December 31: 31 - 24 + 31 + 30 + 31 + 30 + 31 + 31 + 30 + 31 + 20 = 300 days.
- For the next 8 years (1991 to 1998), each year has 365 days: 8 * 365 = 2920 days.
- For the last year (1999), from January 1 to July 20: 31 + 28 + 31 + 30 + 31 + 30 + 20 = 191 days.

First, let's break down the dates into their components:
- Birthdate: 2000-01-14 (Year: 2000, Month: 01, Day: 14)
- Given date: 2003-05-25 (Year: 2003, Month: 05, Day: 25)

1. Years: 2003 - 2000 = 3 years
2. Months: 05 - 01 = 4 months
3. Days: 25 - 14 = 11 days

Since the given date falls within the same year as the birthdate, we don't need to consider any extra days from the previous year. Now, we need to account for the full years and then add the remaining days.

For 3 years, there are 3 * 365 = 1095 days. Then, we add the 4 months and 11 days.

However, we need to check if any of these months have leap years that affect the day count. Since 2000 is a leap year, we need to add one extra day for the month of February in the year 2000.

So, the total number of days is 1095 (from 3 years) + 1 (leap year day) + 11 (remaining days) = 1107 days."", ""age"": 1107}"

2. From 2004-01-01 to 2009-12-31:
   - There are 6 non-leap years and 1 leap year (2004).
   - Total days = (6 * 365) + 366 = 2190 + 366 = 2556 days.

Camila's birthday is on April 4th, and Samuel's birthday is on March 22nd. This means that Camila's birthday comes after Samuel's by about 12 days in the same year. 

To calculate the exact number of days, we should consider the following:

First, let's determine the number of months between August 2014 and May 2017:
- From August 2014 to July 2017 is 3 years minus 1 month, which equals 35 months.
- Adding the remaining months from August to December 2014, we have 5 months.
- From January 2017 to May 2017, we have 5 months.

So, the total months from August 2014 to May 2017 is 35 + 5 + 5 = 45 months. 

Since Alex is younger than Natalie, we subtract the months Alex has lived since his birthdate from the total months between their birthdates:
- Alex was born on May 17, 2017, so he has lived for 0 months at the time of calculation.

Therefore, Alex is 45 months younger than Natalie.

If the character starts studying at 10 PM, we need to add 1 day, 5 hours, 18 minutes, and 35 seconds to 10 PM. Adding 1 day doesn't change the time, so we just need to add 5 hours, 18 minutes, and 35 seconds to 10 PM.

10:00 PM + 5 hours = 3:00 AM
3:00 AM + 18 minutes = 3:18 AM
3:18 AM + 35 seconds = 3:18:35 AM

So, the character will finish all the assignments at 3:18:35 AM."", ""day"": ""+1"", ""time"": ""03:18:35""}"

Adding the seconds: 53 + 22 + 38 = 113 seconds. Since there are 60 seconds in a minute, we convert 113 seconds to 1 minute and 53 seconds.

Adding the minutes: 28 + 43 + 55 + 1 (from the conversion) = 127 minutes. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we convert 127 minutes to 2 hours and 7 minutes.

- Warm-up: 15 hours * 3600 seconds/hour + 48 minutes * 60 seconds/minute + 47 seconds = 54000 + 2880 + 47 = 56927 seconds
- Cardio: 57 minutes * 60 seconds/minute + 57 seconds = 3457 seconds
- Strength Training: 4 hours * 3600 seconds/hour + 54 minutes * 60 seconds/minute + 36 seconds = 14400 + 3240 + 36 = 17676 seconds
- Cool Down: 3 hours * 3600 seconds/hour + 31 minutes * 60 seconds/minute + 23 seconds = 10800 + 1860 + 23 = 12683 seconds

Total time spent: 56927 + 3457 + 17676 + 12683 = 90743 seconds

Now, converting 90743 seconds back to hours, minutes, and seconds:
- Total hours: 90743 / 3600 = 25 hours (remainder: 743 seconds)
- Remaining minutes: 743 / 60 = 12 minutes (remainder: 23 seconds)

So, the total time is 25 hours, 12 minutes, and 23 seconds.

Starting from 04:00 PM, adding 25 hours, 12 minutes, and 23 seconds:

- Adding 12 minutes: 05:00 AM + 12 minutes = 05:12 AM
- Adding 23 seconds: 05:12:00 AM + 23 seconds = 05:12:23 AM

Summing up the hours, minutes, and seconds:

Total hours: 23 + 18 = 41 hours
Total minutes: 59 + 6 + 0 = 65 minutes

Extra minutes: 65 minutes = 1 hour and 5 minutes

3. Sum the two durations:

Since the end time is before the start time, we have to consider it to be on the next day. Therefore, we will add one full day to the end time, making it 06:27:46 PM of the next day.

To calculate the duration, we break down the calculation into two parts:
1. From 01:58:39 PM to midnight (12:00:00 AM)
2. From midnight (12:00:00 AM) to 06:27:46 PM of the next day

For the first part, from 01:58:39 PM to midnight (12:00:00 AM):
- Time from 01:58:39 PM to 12:00:00 AM = 10 hours, 2 minutes, and 21 seconds

For the second part, from midnight (12:00:00 AM) to 06:27:46 PM of the next day:
- Time from 12:00:00 AM to 06:27:46 PM = 18 hours, 27 minutes, and 46 seconds

Now, adding both parts together:
- Total hours = 10 + 18 = 28 hours
- Total minutes = 2 + 27 = 29 minutes
- Total seconds = 21 + 46 = 67 seconds

Since 67 seconds is greater than 60 seconds, we convert 67 seconds to 1 minute and 7 seconds. Adding this to the minutes gives us 30 minutes. And since 29 minutes plus 1 minute equals 30 minutes, we convert 30 minutes to 0 hours and 30 minutes. Finally, we add the extra hour to the total hours, giving us 29 hours and 30 minutes.

Next, calculate the time from 00:00:00 to 19:57:11:

- Minutes: 57 minutes
- Seconds: 11 seconds

Now, add these two durations together:
- Total hours: 3 + 19 = 22 hours
- Total minutes: 35 + 57 = 92 minutes (which is 1 hour and 32 minutes)

- 58 minutes + 8 minutes = 66 minutes (which is 1 hour and 6 minutes)

First, we calculate the time from 21:00:37 to midnight:
- From 21:00:37 to 23:59:59: 2 hours and 59 minutes and 22 seconds
- Convert 2 hours and 59 minutes and 22 seconds to seconds: (2 * 3600) + (59 * 60) + 22 = 11982 seconds

Since the end time is earlier than the start time, we need to consider the next day. To calculate the total time, we can break down the problem into parts: subtracting the initial part of the day and adding the remaining part of the next day.

From 20:06:45 to 23:59:59 of the same day:
- From 20:06:45 to 23:59:59 is 3 hours and 53 minutes and 14 seconds.

From 00:00:00 to 15:34:08 of the next day:
- From 00:00:00 to 15:34:08 is 15 hours and 34 minutes and 8 seconds.

Total time:
- Adding the two parts: 3 hours 53 minutes 14 seconds + 15 hours 34 minutes 8 seconds.

Converting everything to seconds:
- 3 hours = 3 * 3600 = 10800 seconds
- 53 minutes = 53 * 60 = 3180 seconds
- 14 seconds = 14 seconds
- 15 hours = 15 * 3600 = 54000 seconds
- 34 minutes = 34 * 60 = 2040 seconds
- 8 seconds = 8 seconds

Adding these up:
- 10800 + 3180 + 14 + 54000 + 2040 + 8 = 70142 seconds.

Converting back to hours, minutes, and seconds:
- 70142 seconds / 3600 = 19 hours with a remainder of 2222 seconds.
- 2222 seconds / 60 = 37 minutes with a remainder of 2 seconds.

Thus, the total time is 19 hours, 37 minutes, and 2 seconds."", ""hours"": 19, ""minutes"": 37, ""seconds"": 2}"

Adding the 40 seconds gives us a total of 10800 + 1740 + 40 = 12580 seconds for one round. 

Next, we need to find out how long it would take for 23 rounds. This is done by multiplying the time for one round by 23, which is 12580 * 23 = 289340 seconds.

Now, we need to convert this total time back into hours, minutes, and seconds. 
- Hours: 289340 / 3600 = 80 hours (with a remainder of 13340 seconds)
- Minutes: 13340 / 60 = 222 minutes (with a remainder of 20 seconds)
- Seconds: The remainder from the last calculation is 20 seconds.

So, the total time is 80 hours, 222 minutes, and 20 seconds. However, we should adjust the minutes to fit within an hour. Since 222 minutes is 3 hours and 42 minutes, we add 3 hours to the hours and 42 minutes to the minutes. This gives us 83 hours, 42 minutes, and 20 seconds.

So, 1 mile takes 3600 + 2580 + 32 = 6212 seconds.

Next, we need to calculate the total time for 9 miles. Since the robot takes 6212 seconds to run 1 mile, it will take 9 * 6212 = 55908 seconds to run 9 miles.

1 hour = 3600 seconds
21 minutes = 21 * 60 = 1260 seconds
26 seconds = 26 seconds

So, the total time to color one book is 3600 + 1260 + 26 = 4886 seconds.

Next, we add the times of all three runners: 5440 + 10210 + 9640 = 25290 seconds.

Now, we need to convert 25290 seconds back into hours, minutes, and seconds:
- Hours: 25290 // 3600 = 7 (since 25290 / 3600 = 7 with a remainder)
- Remaining seconds after subtracting the hours: 25290 - (7 * 3600) = 25290 - 25200 = 90 seconds
- Minutes: 90 // 60 = 1 (since 90 / 60 = 1 with a remainder)
- Remaining seconds after subtracting the minutes: 90 - (1 * 60) = 90 - 60 = 30 seconds

\(135 \div 60 = 2\) hours and \(15\) minutes (since \(135 - 2 \times 60 = 15\)).

So, it takes 2 hours, 28 minutes, and 12 seconds to study one page.

So, the total time in seconds is 14400 + 2760 + 52 = 17212 seconds.

Since Jack responds to 2 emails in 17212 seconds, we can find the time taken to respond to 1 email by dividing 17212 by 2, which gives us 8606 seconds per email.

36 seconds / 2 = 18 seconds

So, it takes the robot 0.5 hours, 8.5 minutes, and 18 seconds to play one game. 

Now, we need to find out the time it takes to play 16 games. We multiply each component by 16.

0.5 hours * 16 = 8 hours
8.5 minutes * 16 = 136 minutes
18 seconds * 16 = 288 seconds

Next, we convert 136 minutes into hours and remaining minutes:
136 minutes / 60 = 2 hours and 16 minutes

Then, we convert 288 seconds into minutes and remaining seconds:
288 seconds / 60 = 4 minutes and 48 seconds

So, the total time to play 16 games is 8 hours, 2 hours, 16 minutes, 4 minutes, and 48 seconds. Combining the hours, we get 10 hours, 20 minutes, and 48 seconds. Thus, the final answer is H = 10, M = 20, S = 48."", ""H"": 10, ""M"": 20, ""S"": 48}"

Adding them up, 14400 + 2520 + 22 = 16942 seconds. 

Next, we need to find out how much time it takes to learn one magic trick. We do this by dividing the total time in seconds by the number of tricks: 16942 / 2 = 8471 seconds.

Now, we need to find out how much time it would take to learn 17 magic tricks. We do this by multiplying the time for one trick by 17: 8471 * 17 = 143907 seconds.

Finally, we need to convert this time back into hours, minutes, and seconds. First, we find the number of hours by dividing the total seconds by 3600: 143907 / 3600 = 39.9741667 hours. The integer part is 39 hours.

Next, we find the remaining seconds after accounting for the hours: 143907 - (39 * 3600) = 143907 - 140400 = 3507 seconds.

Then, we find the number of minutes by dividing the remaining seconds by 60: 3507 / 60 = 58.45 minutes. The integer part is 58 minutes.

Lastly, we find the remaining seconds after accounting for the minutes: 3507 - (58 * 60) = 3507 - 3480 = 27 seconds.

- 18 seconds = 18 seconds

Adding them together gives us the total time in seconds for backing up 2 phones: 14400 + 720 + 18 = 15138 seconds.

Since we want to know the total time for backing up 15 phones, we multiply the time for 2 phones by 15/2:

Round 4: 0 hour 55 minutes 50 seconds

Adding them up:
1 + 1 + 1 + 0 = 3 hours
40 + 10 + 55 + 55 = 160 minutes
50 + 30 + 50 + 50 = 200 seconds

Now we convert 160 minutes into hours and seconds. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we can divide 160 by 60 to get the number of whole hours and the remaining minutes:
160 / 60 = 2 hours and 40 minutes.

So, the total time in hours, minutes, and seconds is 3 hours 2 hours 40 minutes 200 seconds. This simplifies to 5 hours 40 minutes 200 seconds.

Next, we need to convert 200 seconds into minutes and seconds. Since there are 60 seconds in a minute, we can divide 200 by 60 to get the number of whole minutes and the remaining seconds:
200 / 60 = 3 minutes and 20 seconds.

So, the total time in hours, minutes, and seconds is 5 hours 43 minutes 20 seconds.

Now, we can find the average time per round by dividing the total time by the number of rounds:
(5 hours 43 minutes 20 seconds) / 4 rounds.

Let's convert everything into seconds for easier calculation:
5 hours = 5 * 3600 = 18000 seconds
43 minutes = 43 * 60 = 2580 seconds
20 seconds = 20 seconds

Total time in seconds: 18000 + 2580 + 20 = 20600 seconds

Average time per round: 20600 seconds / 4 = 5150 seconds

Now we convert 5150 seconds back to hours, minutes, and seconds"

Next, we need to find out how long it will take her to color 13 books at the same rate.

For minutes:
10 * 13 = 130 minutes

For seconds:
28 * 13 = 364 seconds

Now, we convert 130 minutes and 364 seconds into hours, minutes, and seconds:

130 minutes is equal to 2 hours and 10 minutes (since 130 / 60 = 2 with a remainder of 10).

364 seconds is equal to 6 minutes and 4 seconds (since 364 / 60 = 6 with a remainder of 4).

Now, to find out how long it will take her to prepare 9 postcards, we multiply the time it takes to prepare one postcard by 9:

14 minutes and 13 seconds * 9 = 126 minutes and 117 seconds.

Next, we need to convert the total time into hours, minutes, and seconds. Since there are 60 seconds in a minute and 60 minutes in an hour, we can convert the total time as follows:

- Convert 117 seconds to minutes and seconds: 117 seconds = 1 minute and 57 seconds.
- Add the extra minute to the total minutes: 126 minutes + 1 minute = 127 minutes.
- Convert 127 minutes to hours and minutes: 127 minutes = 2 hours and 7 minutes.

Total time for 8 riddles = 8 * (51 minutes and 25 seconds).

Let's break this down:

- For the minutes: 8 * 51 = 408 minutes.
- For the seconds: 8 * 25 = 200 seconds.

Now, we need to convert 408 minutes and 200 seconds into hours, minutes, and seconds.

Since there are 60 seconds in a minute, we can convert 200 seconds into minutes and seconds:
200 seconds / 60 = 3 minutes and 20 seconds.

So, the total time is 408 minutes and 3 minutes and 20 seconds. Combining these, we get 411 minutes and 20 seconds.

To find the starting year of the E73 age, we need to add 73 periods of 1259 years to the end of the E20 age.

First, let's determine the end year of the E20 age:
End year of E20 = 336 BC + 1259 years = 923 BC

Now, we need to find the starting year of the E73 age by adding 73 * 1259 years to the end year of the E20 age:
Starting year of E73 = 923 BC + (73 * 1259) years

Let's calculate the number of years:
73 * 1259 = 91887

Since we are dealing with BC, we subtract this from 923 BC:
Starting year of E73 = 923 BC - 91887 years
