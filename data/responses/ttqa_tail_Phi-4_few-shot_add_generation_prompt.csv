","Dhanraj Pillay was born on 16 July 1968. He joined the Indian national team in 1989. To find out how old he was when he joined the national team, we calculate the difference between 1989 and 1968.

1989 - 1968 = 21

Since he joined in 1989 and his birthday is on 16 July, he would have turned 21 in July 1989. Therefore, he joined the national team at the age of 21.

","Dhanraj Pillay was born on 16 July 1968. He played for Indian Gymkhana during the 1992-1993 period. To find out his age during this time, we need to calculate his age in 1992 and 1993.

1. Calculate his age in 1992:
   - 1992 - 1968 = 24
   - Since his birthday on 16 July had not occurred by the start of 1992, he was still 23 years old at the beginning of 1992.
   - He turned 24 on 16 July 1992.

2. Calculate his age in 1993:
   - 1993 - 1968 = 25
   - He was 24 until 16 July 1993, after which he turned 25.

Therefore, Dhanraj Pillay was 24 years old when he started playing for Indian Gymkhana in 1992 and turned 25 during that season.

Final Answer: 24 years old when he started, turning 25 during the season."

2. End date: 17 October 1994

From 1 October 1978 to 1 October 1994 is 16 years. From 1 October 1994 to 17 October 1994 is an additional 16 days, which does not add up to a full year.

Therefore, Kapil Dev played ODI cricket for 16 years.

To calculate the duration of the main period:
- Start: Late 1968
- End: Mid-1988

From late 1968 to late 1987 is 19 years. Adding the additional time from late 1987 to mid-1988 gives approximately 20 years in total.

","To find out how many Neptunian solar days are in one Neptunian orbital period, we need to compare the length of a Neptunian solar day to the length of a Neptunian year (orbital period).

1. **Neptunian Solar Day**: The rotation period of Neptune is given as 0.67125 days (synodic; solar day).

2. **Neptunian Orbital Period**: The orbital period of Neptune is 164.8 Earth years. To convert this into days, we use the fact that one Earth year is approximately 365.25 days (accounting for leap years):

   \[
   164.8 \text{ years} \times 365.25 \text{ days/year} = 60,195 \text{ days}
   \]

3. **Number of Neptunian Solar Days in One Neptunian Year**:

   To find the number of Neptunian solar days in one Neptunian year, divide the total number of Earth days in a Neptunian year by the length of a Neptunian solar day:

   \[
   \frac{60,195 \text{ days}}{0.671"

2. From 2 September 1938 to 2 December 1938 is 3 months. September has 28 days remaining (30 - 2), October has 31 days, and November has 30 days. So, 28 + 31 + 30 = 89 days.
3. From 2 December 1938 to 5 December 1938 is 3 days.

Adding these together: 365 + 89 + 3 = 457 days.

","The table provides information about the ship I-179, not I-176. However, we can determine the number of days between the launch of I-179 and the sinking of its sister ship, I-176, using the provided dates.

1. I-179 was launched on 16 July 1942.
2. I-176 was sunk on 19 August 1942.

To find the number of days between these two dates:

- Start from 16 July 1942.
- Count the days remaining in July: 31 (total days in July) - 16 = 15 days.
- Add the days in August up to and including 19 August: 19 days.

Total days = 15 (July) + 19 (August) = 34 days.

","To determine how many days before D-Day the I-179 was sunk, we need to know the dates of both events:

1. **D-Day** occurred on June 6, 1944.
2. The I-179 was sunk on July 14, 1943.

Now, calculate the number of days between July 14, 1943, and June 6, 1944:

- From July 14, 1943, to July 14, 1944, is 1 year or 365 days (1944 is not a leap year).
- Subtract the days from June 6, 1944, to July 14, 1944:

  - June has 30 days, so from June 6 to June 30 is 24 days.
  - Add the 14 days of July up to July 14.

  Total days from June 6 to July 14, 1944, is 24 + 14 = 38 days.

- Subtract these 38 days from 365 days:

  365 - 38 = 327 days.

The I-179 was sunk 327 days before D-Day.

","To determine how many months ago COVID-19 arrived in Johor, we need to calculate the time between the arrival date and the current date, which is December 2022.

1. Arrival date in Johor: 25 January 2020
2. Current date: December 2022

First, calculate the number of full years between 2020 and 2022:
- From January 2020 to January 2022 is 2 years.

Next, calculate the number of months from January 2022 to December 2022:
- From January 2022 to December 2022 is 11 months.

Now, add the months from the full years:
- 2 years = 24 months

Total months from January 2020 to December 2022:
- 24 months (from 2 years) + 11 months = 35 months

Since the arrival was on January 25, 2020, and we are considering up to December 2022, we do not need to adjust for partial months.

","The table provides the dates for when HMS Montrose was laid down and launched, but these dates are not in the year 2005. According to the table:

- HMS Montrose was laid down on 1 November 1989.
- HMS Montrose was launched on 31 July 1992.

To find the number of months between these two dates:

1. Calculate the number of full years between 1989 and 1992: 1992 - 1989 = 3 years.
2. Convert these years into months: 3 years × 12 months/year = 36 months.
3. Since the ship was laid down in November 1989 and launched in July 1992, we need to adjust for the months within these years:
   - From November 1989 to November 1991 is 2 full years, which is 24 months.
   - From November 1991 to July 1992 is an additional 8 months.

Adding these together gives: 24 months + 8 months = 32 months.

","To find out how many more days there were between the Western and Eastern Easter dates in 2024 compared to 2022, we need to calculate the difference in days for each year and then find the difference between these two results.

1. **2022:**
   - Western Easter: April 17
   - Eastern Easter: April 24
   - Difference: April 24 - April 17 = 7 days

2. **2024:**
   - Western Easter: March 31
   - Eastern Easter: May 5
   - Difference: May 5 - March 31

   To calculate the difference between March 31 and May 5:
   - From March 31 to April 30 is 30 days (since March has 31 days, and we start counting from April 1).
   - From April 30 to May 5 is 5 days.
   - Total difference: 30 + 5 = 35 days

3. **Difference between 2024 and 2022:**
   - 2024 difference: 35 days
   - 2022 difference: 7 days
   - Difference between the two: 35 - 7 = 28 days

","The ExoMars mission's planned duration is 7 years. As of the current date, December 2022, the mission has already been in progress for 6 years, 3 months, and 18 days.

To find out how many more months the mission is planned to last, we first calculate the total planned duration in months:

- 7 years = 7 × 12 months = 84 months

Next, we calculate the elapsed time in months:

- 6 years = 6 × 12 months = 72 months

- Macmillan: 1960 - 1957 = 3 years

","To determine how many more years Arnaldo Schulz was a leader or commander than Filipe Samuel Magaia, we need to look at their respective periods of leadership:

1. **Arnaldo Schulz** was a leader in Portuguese Guinea from 1964 to 1968. This is a period of 4 years.

2. **Filipe Samuel Magaia** was a leader in Mozambique from 1964 to 1966. This is a period of 2 years.

Now, subtract the length of Filipe Samuel Magaia's leadership from Arnaldo Schulz's:

4 years (Schulz) - 2 years (Magaia) = 2 years

Arnaldo Schulz was a leader or commander for 2 more years than Filipe Samuel Magaia.

","The I-179 was laid down on 21 August 1941 and completed on 18 June 1943. To find the number of years between these two dates, we calculate the difference between 1943 and 1941, which is 2 years. However, since the completion date (18 June 1943) is before the laying down date (21 August 1941) within the year, we need to account for the months and days to determine if a full year has passed.

From 21 August 1941 to 21 August 1942 is 1 year. From 21 August 1942 to 18 June 1943 is less than a year. Therefore, the total time from laying down to completion is 1 year and about 10 months.

","The table indicates that the ship I-179 was sunk during sea trials on 14 July 1943 and was salvaged and scrapped in 1957. The question asks about the sister ship I-176, but the table only provides information about I-179. Assuming the sister ship I-176 followed a similar timeline, we can use the year 1957 as a reference for when it was likely salvaged and scrapped.

Given that the current date is December 2022, we calculate the number of years since 1957:

2022 - 1957 = 65 years

To find the number of years between these two events, subtract the year of the Marseille event from the year of the Cairo event: 2021-22 - 2017 = 4-5 years. Since the Cairo event spans two years (2021-22), it is more precise to say 4 years between the end of the Marseille event and the start of the Cairo event.

","The ship Tonnerre was commissioned on 21 July 1808 and was burned and exploded on 12 April 1809. To find out how many years it sailed before it was destroyed, we calculate the time between these two dates.

1. From 21 July 1808 to 21 July 1809 is one year.
2. However, the ship was destroyed on 12 April 1809, which is before 21 July 1809.

To find the exact duration:
- From 21 July 1808 to 21 April 1809 is 9 months.
- From 21 April 1809 to 12 April 1809 is 9 days less than a full month.

Thus, the ship sailed for 9 months and 22 days before it was burned down.

","The Tonnerre was laid down on 22 September 1794 and launched on 9 June 1808. To find the number of years between these two dates, we calculate the difference between 1808 and 1794, which is 14 years. However, since the launch date (9 June 1808) is before the laying down date (22 September 1794) within the year, we do not count the full year of 1808. Therefore, the elapsed time is 13 years and a few months.

Final Answer: 13 years and a few months."

2. **Party of Democratic Kampuchea**: Active from 1981 to 1990.

","The HMS Montrose was ordered in July 1988 and commissioned on 2 June 1994. To find the number of years between these two dates, calculate the difference between 1994 and 1988:

1994 - 1988 = 6 years

Since the commissioning date (2 June 1994) is before the end of July 1994, the full 6 years have not yet passed by the end of July 1994. Therefore, the time between ordering and commissioning is just under 6 years.

Final Answer: Just under 6 years."

","The Tonnerre was laid down on 22 September 1794 and launched on 9 June 1808. To find the number of years between these two dates, we calculate the difference between 1808 and 1794, which is 14 years. However, since the launch date (9 June 1808) is before the laying down date (22 September 1794) within the year, we do not count the full year of 1808. Therefore, the time between the laying down and the launch is 13 years and about 9 months.

","To determine the number of years Rubens Barrichello was active in his career, we need to consider his active years in each of his major racing series:

1. **Formula One World Championship career**: Active from 1993 to 2011.
   - 2011 - 1993 = 18 years

2. **Stock Car Brasil career**: Active from 2012 to at least 2020 (as he finished 6th in the 2020 season).
   - 2020 - 2012 = 8 years

3. **IndyCar Series career**: Active in 2012.
   - 1 year

Now, we need to consider the overlap between these series. His Formula One career ended in 2011, and his Stock Car Brasil career began in 2012, so there is no overlap between these two. His IndyCar Series career was in 2012, which overlaps with the start of his Stock Car Brasil career.

To find the total number of unique years he was active, we add the years from each series, accounting for the overlap:

- Formula One: 18 years (1993-2011)
- Stock Car Brasil: 8 years (2012-2020)

","HMS Argyll was ordered in September 1986 and commissioned on 31 May 1991. To find the number of years between these two dates, calculate the difference from September 1986 to May 1991.

1. From September 1986 to September 1990 is 4 years.
2. From September 1990 to May 1991 is an additional 8 months.

Since we are calculating in years, 8 months is approximately 0.67 years.

Adding these together: 4 years + 0.67 years = 4.67 years.

Final Answer: Approximately 4.67 years."

   - Second period: 2016 - 2021

   For the first period, since the starting year is not specified, we'll assume he started at the earliest possible year, which is 0000. Therefore, the duration is 2005 - 0000 = 2005 years.

   For the second period, the duration is 2021 - 2016 = 5 years.

   Total duration with Club Egara = 2005 + 5 = 2010 years.

2. **Laren:**

","To determine how much longer Kimi Räikkönen was active in Formula One compared to the World Rally Championship, we need to calculate the duration of his active years in each series.

1. **Formula One Active Years:**
   - Räikkönen's Formula One career spanned from 2001 to 2009 and then from 2012 to 2021.
   - First period: 2001 to 2009 is 9 years.
   - Second period: 2012 to 2021 is 10 years.
   - Total Formula One active years = 9 + 10 = 19 years.

2. **World Rally Championship Active Years:**
   - Räikkönen's World Rally Championship career spanned from 2009 to 2011.
   - This period is 3 years.

3. **Difference in Active Years:**
   - Formula One active years (19) minus World Rally Championship active years (3) = 16 years.

Next, check if he had already had his birthday in 1928 by the time of his Test debut on 30 November. Since 30 November is after 27 August, he had already turned 20 in 1928.

Therefore, Don Bradman was 20 years old during his Test debut.

2. Since he retired in November 1945 and his birthday is on February 9, he had already turned 33 by February 9, 1945.

Therefore, he was 33 years old when he retired.

","Francesco Moser was born on 19 June 1951. He first rode for Famcucine–Campagnolo in 1981. To find out how old he was at that time, subtract the year of birth from the year he started with Famcucine–Campagnolo: 1981 - 1951 = 30. Since he started in 1981 and his birthday is on 19 June, he would have turned 30 on 19 June 1981. If he started before 19 June 1981, he would have been 29 at the time. However, since the exact start date in 1981 is not specified, we assume he was 30 when he began riding for Famcucine–Campagnolo.

","Roger De Vlaeminck was born on 24 August 1947. He won an individual stage of the Tour de France in 1970. To determine his age at the time of this win, we need to consider the year of the win and his birth year.

1. Calculate the difference in years between 1970 and 1947:  
   \(1970 - 1947 = 23\).

2. Since the Tour de France stage win occurred in 1970 and his birthday is on 24 August, we need to check if the win happened before or after his birthday in 1970. The Tour de France typically takes place in July, which is before 24 August.

3. Since the win occurred before his birthday in 1970, he was still 22 years old at the time of the win.

","The table provides the following relevant information:

- The annual exports of the Australian Defence Force were around A$2 billion in 2018.
- The active personnel count was 59,095 as of 30 June 2020.

Since the question asks for the year when both conditions were met, we need to find a year where the annual exports were around A$2 billion and the active personnel count was 59,095. The exports figure is given for 2018, but the personnel count is for 2020. There is no direct information in the table that links these two figures to the same year. However, since the personnel count is a snapshot as of 30 June 2020, and there is no indication of a change in personnel numbers between 2018 and 2020, it is reasonable to assume that the personnel count of 59,095 could have been applicable in 2018 as well.

Therefore, the year when the Australian Defence Force's annual exports totaled around A$2 billion and the active personnel reserve was at 59,095 is likely 2018.

","Mardi Gras is celebrated on the day before Ash Wednesday, which is 47 days before Easter. The date of Easter varies each year, but it falls between March 22 and April 25. Therefore, Mardi Gras can occur as early as February 3 (if Easter is on March 25) and as late as March 9 (if Easter is on April 18).

To determine the earliest possible Mardi Gras date, we need to find the year when Easter falls on March 25. This happens when the full moon (the Paschal Full Moon) falls on March 21, which is the latest possible date for the Paschal Full Moon.

The Gregorian calendar follows a 19-year cycle for the date of Easter, known as the Metonic cycle. Within this cycle, the earliest possible date for Easter (March 22) occurs in years 4, 7, 9, 13, 16, and 19. The latest possible date for Easter (April 25) occurs in years 5, 6, 11, 14, 18, and 19.

","To determine the year of Alejandro Valverde's first Tour de France victory, we need to look at his major wins in the Tour de France. The table lists his Tour de France victories as ""4 individual stages (2005, 2008, 2012)."" This indicates that he won individual stages in these years, but it does not mention a general classification victory in the Tour de France. 

The table also lists his major wins in the Vuelta a España, where he won the general classification in 2009. Since the question specifically asks about the Tour de France, and there is no mention of a general classification win in the Tour de France, we can conclude that Valverde did not achieve a general classification victory in the Tour de France.

Final Answer: Alejandro Valverde did not achieve a Tour de France general classification victory."

['Hanukkah חג חנוכה.jpg | Dreidels, hanukkiah, and sufganiyot']

","Hanukkah begins on the 25th of Kislev in the Hebrew calendar. The Hebrew calendar is a lunisolar calendar, meaning that the months are based on lunar cycles, but the years are adjusted to align with the solar year. This results in the Hebrew months shifting slightly each year relative to the Gregorian calendar.

To determine when Hanukkah occurs earliest in the Gregorian calendar, we need to find the year when the 25th of Kislev falls earliest in the year. This happens when the Hebrew year starts late in the Gregorian year, causing the 25th of Kislev to occur early in the Gregorian year.

The Hebrew year 5783 began on the evening of September 6, 2022, and the 25th of Kislev in 5783 fell on December 18, 2022. This is the earliest start date for Hanukkah in the Gregorian calendar in recent years.

","Hanukkah begins on the 25th of Kislev and ends on the 2nd or 3rd of Tevet. The Jewish calendar is a lunisolar calendar, meaning that the months are based on lunar cycles, but the years are adjusted to align with the solar year. This results in the Jewish holidays shifting each year relative to the Gregorian calendar.

To determine when Hanukkah occurs latest in the year, we need to consider when the month of Kislev falls latest in the Gregorian calendar. This happens in a leap year in the Jewish calendar, which has an extra month, Adar II, inserted before Nisan. This causes the months of the Jewish calendar to shift later in the Gregorian calendar.

In a Jewish leap year, Hanukkah can occur as late as late December or early January. According to the table, in 2024, Hanukkah begins on the sunset of December 25th and ends on the nightfall of January 2nd. This is the latest occurrence of Hanukkah in the Gregorian calendar within the years provided.

","To determine over how many years the Western Easter date falls in April, we need to examine the provided dates for the years 2021 to 2024:

- 2021: April 4
- 2022: April 17
- 2023: April 9
- 2024: March 31

From this list, we see that in 2021, 2022, and 2023, the Western Easter date falls in April. In 2024, it falls on March 31, which is not in April.

Thus, the Western Easter date falls in April for 3 years out of the 4 years listed.

","To find the difference in days between Black Friday in 2024 and 2022, we first identify the dates:

- Black Friday in 2022 is on November 25, 2022.
- Black Friday in 2024 is on November 29, 2024.

Next, we calculate the number of days between these two dates:

1. From November 25, 2022, to November 25, 2023, is 1 year.
2. From November 25, 2023, to November 25, 2024, is another year, making it 2 years in total.
3. From November 25, 2024, to November 29, 2024, is 4 days.

Now, calculate the total number of days:

- 2 years = 2 × 365 days = 730 days (2023 is not a leap year)
- Add the 4 extra days from November 25 to November 29, 2024.

Total days = 730 + 4 = 734 days.

Final Answer: 734 days"

","The synodic period of Mars is the time it takes for Mars to return to the same position relative to Earth and the Sun. This period is given as 779.96 days.

To find the difference in the synodic period between Mars and Earth in years, we first need to convert the synodic period of Mars from days to years. We know that 1 year is approximately 365.25 days (accounting for leap years).

1. Convert the synodic period of Mars from days to years:
   \[
   \text{Synodic period in years} = \frac{779.96 \text{ days}}{365.25 \text{ days/year}} \approx 2.1354 \text{ years}
   \]

2. The synodic period of Earth relative to itself is 1 year (since it takes 1 year for Earth to return to the same position relative to the Sun).

3. Calculate the difference in the synodic period between Mars and Earth:
   \[
   \text{Difference} = 2.1354 \text{ years} - 1 \text{ year} = 1.1354 \text{ years}
   \]

","The fatality map is labeled as ""Deaths per 100,000 residents by department up to July 2020."" This indicates that the data on the map is up to July 2020.

The confirmed cases map is labeled as ""Map of positive tests by regions as of 5 May 2022."" This indicates that the data on the map is as of May 2022.

To find the time difference in months between these two dates:

1. Start from July 2020 and count the months up to May 2022.
2. From July 2020 to July 2021 is 12 months.
3. From July 2021 to May 2022 is 10 months.

Adding these together gives a total of 22 months.
