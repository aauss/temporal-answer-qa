['A photograph of a small, old book with Hebrew text and an illustration on the right-hand page. | 18th-century manuscript of the prayer of Al HaNissim on the miracles of Purim']

","To determine the year after 2024 when the next celebration of Purim will occur, we need to understand the pattern of the date for Purim. According to the table, Purim is celebrated on the 14th day of Adar (or the 15th day of Adar in Jerusalem and all ancient walled cities).

The dates provided for Purim in subsequent years show a consistent pattern where the celebration shifts based on the lunar calendar, which means it usually falls on different Gregorian dates each year. However, the key point is that the date is determined by the Hebrew calendar, not the Gregorian one.

Since the dates given for Purim in the subsequent years (2023, 2024, etc.) are spaced approximately 354 days apart (the length of one Hebrew year), we can infer that Purim will be celebrated again in the same relative position within the Gregorian calendar about every 12 months.

Given that the next celebration after 2024 will be in 2025, we can conclude that the next celebration of Purim will occur in 2025.

","To determine Brian Lara's age when he played his last ODI, we need to follow these steps:

1. Identify the date of his last ODI: 21 April 2007.
2. Determine Brian Lara's birth date: 2 May 1969.
3. Calculate the difference between these dates.

First, let's calculate the difference between 21 April 2007 and 2 May 1969:

- From 2 May 1969 to 31 December 1969: 8 months and 29 days.
- From 1 January 2007 to 21 April 2007: 4 months and 20 days.

Now, summing up the years and months:
- From 1969 to 2006: 37 years.
- Adding the months: 8 + 4 = 12 months, which is exactly one year.

So, the total time span is 38 years.

Since his birthday (2 May) comes after his last ODI (21 April), we need to subtract one year from the total span.

Therefore, Brian Lara was 37 years old when he played his last ODI.

From the table:
- Chiyonofuji Mitsugu was born on June 1, 1955.
- He retired in May 1991.

Since he retired in May 1991 and was born in June 1955, we can conclude that he had not yet reached his birthday in 1991. Therefore, we need to count the full years between his birth year and the year he retired.

1991 - 1955 = 36 years

","To determine the age at which Dhanraj Pillay joined the national team, we need to find when he first represented India and calculate his age at that time.

From the ""National team"" section, we can see that Dhanraj Pillay's career with the Indian national team spanned from 1989 to 2004.

His birth year is given as 1968-07-16.

To find out the age in 1989:
- Calculate the difference between 1989 and 1968: 1989 - 1968 = 21
- Since he was born in July and it was already 1989 by the end of the year, he would have turned 21 in 1989.

Therefore, Dhanraj Pillay joined the national team at the age of 21.

","To determine the age at which Don Bradman joined his second domestic team, we need to identify when he switched from New South Wales to South Australia.

From the table, we see that:
- His first domestic team was New South Wales from 1927/28 to 1933/34.
- His second domestic team was South Australia from 1935/36 onwards.

Next, we calculate his age during the transition period:
- The transition occurred in the 1934/35 season.
- We know he was born on 27 August 1908.

We can calculate his age as follows:
- From 27 August 1908 to 30 June 1934 (end of the 1933/34 season): 
  1934 - 1908 = 26 years old.
- From 1 July 1934 to 30 June 1935 (start of the 1935/36 season):
  26 + 1 = 27 years old.

Therefore, Don Bradman was 27 years old when he joined his second domestic team, South Australia.

","To determine the age at which Eddy Merckx last won 34 individual stages at the Tour de France, we need to identify the years when he won these stages and then calculate his age at the time of the last win.

From the ""Major wins"" section, we can see that Eddy Merckx won 34 individual stages during the years 1969-1972 and 1974. 

- In 1969, he won 9 stages.
- In 1970, he won 7 stages.
- In 1971, he won 8 stages.
- In 1972, he won 6 stages.
- In 1974, he won 4 stages.

The last year he won 34 individual stages was 1972.

Next, we need to calculate his age in 1972. Eddy Merckx was born on June 17, 1945. To find his age in 1972, we subtract his birth year from 1972:

1972 - 1945 = 27

Therefore, Eddy Merckx was 27 years old when he last won 34 individual stages at the Tour de France.

From the table:
- Haguroyama Masaji was born on November 18, 1914.
- He reached the highest rank of Yokozuna in May 1941.

Now, let's calculate the difference in years:
1941 - 1914 = 27 years

Next, we need to account for the months. Since both dates are in different months, we'll consider the month difference:
November (1914) to May (1941) spans 7 months (December, January, February, March, April, May).

So, he was 27 years and 7 months old when he became Yokozuna.

Final Answer: Haguroyama Masaji was 27 years and 7 months old when he achieved his highest rank of Yokozuna."

","To determine how long after the Tonnerre was ordered it was commissioned, we need to calculate the difference between the commissioning date and the order date.

1. Commissioned date: 21 July 1808
2. Ordered date: 16 April 1794

First, let's break down the time into years and months:

- From 16 April 1794 to 31 December 1794: 9 months and 15 days
- From 1 January 1795 to 31 December 1807: 13 full years
- From 1 January 1808 to 21 July 1808: 6 months and 21 days

Now, summing these periods:

- 9 months + 13 years * 12 months/year + 6 months = 168 months
- Adding the remaining days: 15 + 21 = 36 days

Since the exact day is not needed for the final calculation, we can convert everything to years:

- 168 months / 12 months/year = 14 years

Therefore, the Tonnerre was commissioned 14 years after it was ordered.

2. **August**: 31 days
3. **September**: 30 days
4. **October**: 1 to 16 = 16 days

Adding these together:

Atlantic hurricane seasons | 2000, 2001, | 2002 | , 2003, 2004

","To determine the duration of the 2002 Atlantic hurricane season in months, we need to calculate the time between the first system forming and the last system dissipating.

- First system formed: July 14, 2002
- Last system dissipated: October 16, 2002

Let's break this down month by month:
1. July 14 to end of July: 19 days (July has 31 days)
2. Entire month of August: 31 days
3. Entire month of September: 30 days
4. From January 1 to October 16: 16 days (October has 31 days)

Now, let's add up the days:
- July: 19 days
- August: 31 days
- September: 30 days
- October: 16 days

Total days = 19 + 31 + 30 + 16 = 96 days

Next, convert the total days into months. Since there are approximately 30.44 days in a month (365 days / 12 months), we can calculate the number of months:

\[ \frac{96 \text{ days}}{30.44 \text{ days/month}} \approx 3.15 \text{ months} \]

Since we are asked for the length in months, we can round this to the nearest whole number or express it as 3 months and some additional days.

Atlantic hurricane seasons | 2003, 2004, | 2005 | , 2006, 2007

","To determine the duration of the 2005 Atlantic hurricane season in months, we need to calculate the time between the first system formation and the last system dissipation.

First, we identify the dates:
- First system formed: June 8, 2005
- Last system dissipated: January 6, 2006

Next, we break down the time period into months:
1. From June 8, 2005, to June 30, 2005: 22 days (June 8 to June 30)
2. Entire month of July 2005: 31 days
3. Entire month of August 2005: 31 days
4. Entire month of September 2005: 30 days
5. Entire month of October 2005: 31 days
6. Entire month of November 2005: 30 days
7. Entire month of December 2005: 31 days
8. From January 1, 2006, to January 6, 2006: 6 days

Adding up the full months:
- 7 full months (July through January)

Adding the partial months:
- 22 days in June + 6 days in January = 28 days

Since we are calculating in months, we convert the 28 days into a fraction of a month:
- 28 days / 30 days per month ≈ 0.933 months

Adding this to the full months:
- 7 months + 0.933 months ≈ 7.933 months

Rounding to the nearest whole number:
- 8 months

Therefore, the 2005 Atlantic hurricane season lasted approximately 8 months.

**For Tests:**
- Debut: 15 November 1989

**For ODIs:**
- Debut: 18 December 1989
- Last appearance: 18 March 2012
- Duration: 2012 - 1989 = 23 years and 2 months

","To find out how many Neptunian solar days are there in one Neptunian orbital period, we need to look at the given orbital period and the sidereal rotation period of Neptune.

From the information provided:
- The orbital period (synodic period) of Neptune is 164.8 years or 60,195 days.
- The sidereal rotation period (or one Neptunian solar day) is 0.6713 days or 16 hours 6 minutes 36 seconds.

Now, we can calculate the total number of Neptunian solar days in one orbital period by dividing the orbital period in days by the length of one Neptunian solar day in days:
\[ \frac{60,195 \text{ days}}{0.6713 \text{ days/day}} \approx 89,666 \]

Therefore, there are approximately 89,666 Neptunian solar days in one Neptunian orbital period.

","To determine how many days after being launched the Maori was commissioned, we need to calculate the difference between its commissioning date and launch date.

1. **Launch Date:** 2 September 1937
2. **Commissioning Date:** 5 December 1938

We will break this into steps:

1. Calculate the number of days from 2 September 1937 to 31 December 1937.
   - From 2 September to 30 September: 29 days
   - October: 31 days
   - November: 30 days
   - December: 31 days up to 31 December

   Total days in 1937: \( 29 + 31 + 30 + 31 = 121 \) days

2. Calculate the number of days from 1 January 1938 to 4 December 1938.

   - February: 28 days (1938 is not a leap year)
   - March: 31 days

   - May: 31 days
   - June: 30 days
   - July: 31 days
   - August: 31 days
   - September: 30 days
   - October: 31 days
   - November: 30 days
   - December: 4 days up to 4 December

   Total days in 1938: \( 31 + 28 + 31 + 30 + 31 + 30 + 31 + 31 + 30 + 31 + 30 + 4 = 335 \) days

3. Add the days from both years:
   - Days from 1937: 121 days
   - Days from 1938: 335 days

   Total days: \( 121 + 335 = 456 \) days

Therefore, the Maori was commissioned 456 days after it was launched.

   - November: 30 days
   - December: 31 days

   Total days in 1987: 29 + 31 + 31 + 30 + 31 + 30 + 31 = 213 days

2. From January 1, 1988, to December 31, 2022:
   - This period spans 35 years (1988 to 2022 inclusive).

   We need to count the number of leap years within this period:

   Total days in 35 years: 12,775 + 3,294 = 16,069 days

3. Adding the days from both periods:
   213 days (1987) + 16,069 days (1988 to 2022) = 16,282 days

","To determine how many days after the anniversary of Madan Lal's first Test he played his last Test, we need to calculate the difference between the dates of his first and last Test matches.

First Test:
- Date: 6 June 1974
- Cap Number: 130

Last Test:
- Date: 19 June 1986
- Cap Number: 363

Now, let's calculate the difference in days between these two dates.

1. Calculate the number of days in each month from June 1974 to May 1986.
2. Add the total number of days from June 1974 to May 1986.
3. Add the days in June 1986 up to the 19th.

Let's break it down:

- From June 1974 to May 1986, there are 12 full years minus one year (since we are counting the starting month but not the ending month).
- Each non-leap year has 365 days, and each leap year has 366 days.
- Leap years between 1974 and 1986 are 1976, 1980, and 1984.

Calculating the total days:
\[ (12 \text{ years} - 1) \times 365 + 3 = 4376 + 3 = 4379 \text{ days} \]

Adding the days in June 1986 up to the 19th:
\[ 4379 + 19 = 4398 \text{ days} \]

Therefore, Madan Lal played his last Test 4398 days after the anniversary of his first Test.

","To determine how many days apart the Armenian Patriarchate of Jerusalem and the Armenian Apostolic Church celebrate Christmas, we need to identify their respective dates of celebration.

From the table:
- The Armenian Apostolic Church celebrates Christmas on January 6.
- The Armenian Patriarchate of Jerusalem celebrates Christmas on January 19 (O.S., which means Old Style).

Since the Armenian Patriarchate of Jerusalem uses the Old Style calendar (O.S.), we need to convert January 19 (O.S.) to the New Style (N.S.) calendar used in the Western world today. 

In the Julian to Gregorian calendar conversion, January 19 (O.S.) typically converts to January 6 (N.S.), which is the same day as the Armenian Apostolic Church's celebration.

Therefore, both celebrations fall on the same day, meaning they are 0 days apart.

","To determine how many days before D-Day the I-179 was sunk, we need to know the date of D-Day and the date the submarine was sunk.

1. **Determine the Date of D-Day:**
   - D-Day refers to the Allied invasion of Normandy during World War II, which occurred on June 6, 1944.

2. **Determine the Date the I-179 Was Sunk:**
   - According to the table, the I-179 was sunk during sea trials on July 14, 1943.

3. **Calculate the Number of Days Between These Dates:**
   - From July 14, 1943, to June 6, 1944, we need to count the days.
   - From July 14, 1943, to the end of 1943: 
     - July: 19 days (from July 14 to July 31)
     - August: 31 days
     - September: 30 days
     - October: 31 days
     - November: 30 days
     - December: 31 days
   - Total days in 1943 from July 14 to December 31: 19 + 31 + 30 + 31 + 30 + 31 = 172 days
   - In 1944, from January 1 to June 6:
     - January: 31 days
     - February: 29 days (leap year)
     - March: 31 days
     - April: 30 days
     - May: 31 days
     - June: 6 days
   - Total days in 1944 from January 1 to June 6: 31 + 29 + 31 + 30 + 31 + 6 = 158 days
   - Adding the days together: 172 + 158 = 330 days

Therefore, the I-179 was sunk 330 days before D-Day.

- Western Christianity observes Christmas on December 25.
- The Armenian Patriarchate of Jerusalem observes Christmas on January 19 (Old Style calendar).

Since the Armenian observance is based on the Old Style (Julian) calendar, we need to convert it to the Gregorian calendar. According to historical records, January 14 (Gregorian) corresponds to January 19 (Julian).

","To determine how many months after being ordered HMS Victory was laid down, we need to calculate the time difference between the order date and the laying-down date.

Order Date: 14 July 1758
Laying Down Date: 23 July 1759

First, let's find out how many full months passed between these dates:

From 14 July 1758 to 31 July 1758: 17 days
August 1758: 31 days
September 1758: 30 days
October 1758: 31 days
November 1758: 30 days
December 1758: 31 days
January 1759: 31 days
February 1759: 28 days
March 1759: 31 days
April 1759: 30 days
May 1759: 23 days (up to the laying down date)

Now, summing up all the days:

17 + 31 + 30 + 31 + 30 + 31 + 31 + 28 + 31 + 30 + 23 = 315 days

Next, convert the total days into months:

315 days ÷ 30.44 days per month (average length of a month) ≈ 10.36 months

Since we need the answer in whole months, we round down to the nearest whole number.

","To determine how many months after being ordered the Maori was laid down, we need to calculate the time difference between the order date and the laying down date.

1. Order Date: 10 March 1936
2. Laying Down Date: 6 July 1936

First, let's break it down month by month:

- From March 10 to March 31: 21 days (March has 31 days, so 31 - 10 + 1 = 22 days, but since we're counting full months, this counts as 1 month)
- April: 30 days (full month)
- May: 31 days (full month)
- June: 30 days (full month)
- From July 1 to July 6: 6 days (part of the month)

Adding up the full months and partial month:

- Full months: 1 (March) + 1 (April) + 1 (May) + 1 (June) = 4 months
- Partial month: 6 days in July, which is less than a full month, so it doesn't add another month.

Therefore, the Maori was laid down 4 months after being ordered.

","To determine how many months after launch the Mars orbiter insertion occurred, we need to calculate the time difference between the launch date and the orbital insertion date.

- Launch date: 14 March 2016
- Orbital insertion date: 19 October 2016

First, let's count the full months between March and October:
- March to April = 1 month
- April to May = 1 month
- May to June = 1 month
- June to July = 1 month
- July to August = 1 month
- August to September = 1 month
- September to October = 1 month

This gives us 7 full months. Now, we need to account for the partial month from March 14 to March 31:
- From March 14 to March 31 = 18 days

Since 18 days is less than a full month, it does not add another month to our count.

Therefore, the total number of months between the launch and the orbital insertion is 7 months.

","To determine how many months ago COVID-19 arrived in Johor, we need to compare the arrival date to the current date, which is December 2022.

The arrival date given in the table is 25 January 2020.

Step 1: Calculate the difference in years.
From January 2020 to December 2022, there are 2 full years.

Step 2: Convert the years into months.
2 years * 12 months/year = 24 months.

Step 3: Consider the current month.
Since we are comparing up to December 2022 and the arrival was in January 2020, we need to account for the remaining months in January 2020.
January has 31 days, and the arrival date is 25 January 2020, which means there are 7 days left in January 2020.

Step 4: Add the remaining days to the total months.
24 months + 7/30 (approximating 7 days as a fraction of a month) ≈ 24.23 months.

Therefore, approximately 24 months have passed since the arrival of COVID-19 in Johor.

","The Israel Defense Forces were founded on May 26, 1948. To determine how many months ago this event occurred, we need to calculate the time difference between the founding date and the current date, which is December 2022.

First, let's break down the time difference into years and months:
- From May 26, 1948, to May 26, 2022, is exactly 74 years.
- From May 26, 2022, to December 2022 is 6 months.

So, the total time difference is 74 years and 6 months. Since there are 12 months in a year, we convert the years to months:
\[ 74 \text{ years} \times 12 \text{ months/year} = 888 \text{ months} \]

Adding the remaining 6 months:
\[ 888 \text{ months} + 6 \text{ months} = 894 \text{ months} \]

Therefore, the Israel Defense Forces was founded 894 months ago.

","To determine how many months ago there were 215,263 confirmed cases, we need to look at the date when this number was recorded and compare it to the current date, which is December 2022.

From the table, we see that the number of confirmed cases was 215,263 as of 25 October 2021.

Now, let's calculate the difference in months:
- From October 25, 2021, to October 31, 2021: 6 days
- November 2021: 30 days
- December 2021: 31 days
- January 2022: 31 days

- September 2022: 30 days
- October 2022: 31 days
- November 2022: 30 days
- December 2022: 28 days (up to today)

Summing these days, we get:
6 + 30 + 31 + 31 + 28 + 31 + 30 + 31 + 31 + 30 + 31 + 30 + 31 + 30 + 28 = 440 days

Since there are approximately 30.44 days in a month, we can convert the total days into months:
440 / 30.44 ≈ 14.45 months

Therefore, there were 215,263 confirmed cases about 14.45 months ago.

","From the information provided in the table:
- HMS Montrose was launched on 31 July 1992.
- It was commissioned on 2 June 1994.

To find the difference in months between the launch and commissioning dates:
1. Calculate the full years between the two dates: 1994 - 1992 = 2 years.
2. Convert the years to months: 2 years * 12 months/year = 24 months.
3. Subtract the months remaining until the commissioning date from the launch date:
   - From 31 July 1992 to 31 July 1993 = 12 months.
   - From 31 July 1993 to 2 June 1994 = 11 months (since 2 June is before 31 July).

Adding these together: 24 months + 12 months + 11 months = 47 months.

Final Answer: It took 47 months for HMS Montrose to be commissioned after its launch in 1992."

","To determine the number of months between the laying down and launching of the Maori, we need to calculate the time difference between the dates given.

1. Laying down date: 6 July 1936
2. Launching date: 2 September 1936

We can break this down into two parts:
- From 6 July to 31 July (end of July): 25 days
- From 1 August to 2 September (beginning of September): 2 days

Now, let's add these days together:
- 25 days in July + 2 days in August = 27 days

Since we need the answer in months, we convert 27 days to months. There are approximately 30.44 days in a month, so:
- 27 days ÷ 30.44 days/month ≈ 0.887 months

However, it's more accurate to count full months:
- July to August is 1 month
- August to September is 1 month

Therefore, the total number of months is 2.

Now, subtract the shorter period (Army) from the longer period (Air Force):
22 months (Air Force) - 18 months (Army) = 4 months

Therefore, the conscription for the Air Force is 4 months longer than for the Army.

- February 2003: 28 days (since it's not a leap year)
- March 2003: 4 days (up to 4 March)

Total days: 29 + 28 + 4 = 61 days

Since there are approximately 30.44 days in a month, we can convert the total days into months:
61 days ÷ 30.44 ≈ 2 months

Therefore, there were approximately 2 months between Waqar Younis's last Test and his last ODI.

","To determine how many more years Alejandro Valverde spent with Illes Balears-Banesto compared to Kelme-Costa Blanca, we need to look at the duration of his association with each team.

For Kelme-Costa Blanca:
- He joined in 2002 and left in 2004.
- Duration: 2004 - 2002 = 2 years.

For Illes Balears-Banesto:
- He joined in 2005 and left in 2010.
- Duration: 2010 - 2005 = 5 years.

Now, we calculate the difference:
- Difference: 5 years (Illes Balears-Banesto) - 2 years (Kelme-Costa Blanca) = 3 years.

Therefore, Alejandro Valverde spent 3 more years with Illes Balears-Banesto than with Kelme-Costa Blanca.

First, calculate the duration of Rhodesia's involvement:
1979 - 1964 = 15 years

Next, calculate the duration of FROLIZI's involvement:
1979 - 1978 = 1 year

Now, find the difference in years:
15 years (Rhodesia) - 1 year (FROLIZI) = 14 years

Therefore, Rhodesia was a belligerent for 14 more years than FROLIZI.

","To determine how many years after Don Bradman's last Test match he died, we need to follow these steps:

1. Identify the date of Don Bradman's last Test match.
2. Identify the date of his death.
3. Calculate the difference between these two dates.

Step 1: From the table, Don Bradman's last Test match was on 18 August 1948.

Step 2: According to the table, Don Bradman died on 25 February 2001.

Step 3: Calculate the difference between 25 February 2001 and 18 August 1948.

- From 1948 to 2001, there are 53 years.
- We need to account for the time between 18 August 1948 and 25 February 2001.

Counting the years:
1948 to 2000 = 52 years
2000 to 2001 = 1 year

So, the total years from 1948 to 2001 is 53 years.

Next, calculate the months and days:
- From 18 August to 31 December (end of 1948) = 4 months and 13 days
- From January 2001 to 25 February 2001 = 2 months and 25 days

Since 4 months + 2 months = 6 months, and 13 days + 25 days = 38 days, this is less than a full year.

Therefore, Don Bradman's death occurred 53 years after his last Test match.

","To determine how many years after FAT was GUNT an Anti-Libyan Chadian faction, we need to identify the time periods for both factions.

1. **FAT (Fédération des Armées du Troisième Mondes)**:
   - Duration: 1978-1979

2. **GUNT (Groupement des Unités Nationales et Traditions)**:
   - Duration: 1986-1987

Next, we calculate the difference between these periods:
- Start of GUNT: 1986
- End of FAT: 1979

The difference in years is:
\[ 1986 - 1979 = 7 \text{ years} \]

Therefore, GUNT was an Anti-Libyan Chadian faction 7 years after FAT ceased to be one.

","To determine how many years after being founded as Birlik the political party was founded as Adal, we need to calculate the difference between the founding dates of the two incarnations of the party.

1. The party was founded as Birlik on 26 April 2013.
2. The party was re-founded as Adal on 5 November 2020.

Next, we calculate the time difference between these two dates:

- From 26 April 2013 to 31 December 2013: 8 months and 5 days
- From 1 January 2014 to 5 November 2020: 6 years and 10 months

Adding these periods together gives us the total time from the founding of Birlik to the re-founding of Adal:

8 months + 6 years + 10 months = 7 years and 18 months

Converting this to years:

7 years + (18 months / 12) = 7 years + 1.5 years = 8.5 years

Therefore, the political party was founded as Adal 8.5 years after being founded as Birlik.

","To determine how many years after being laid down the HMS Astute was launched, we need to calculate the difference between the launch date and the laid-down date.

1. Laid down date: 31 January 2001
2. Launched date: 8 June 2007

First, let's convert these dates into years since the laid-down date:
- For 31 January 2001, it's 0 years (since it's the starting point).
- For 8 June 2007, it's approximately 6.5 years (since it's 6 months and some days into the year).

To find the exact number of years, we can break it down:
- From 31 January 2001 to 31 December 2001: 1 year
- From 1 January 2002 to 31 December 2006: 5 more years
- From 1 January 2007 to 8 June 2007: approximately 5 months (which is less than a full year)

Adding these together:
1 + 5 + (less than 1 year) = 6 years and some months

Since we are asked for the number of years, we can round this to 6 years.

","To determine how many years after being laid down the HMS Victory was launched, we need to find the difference between the year it was launched and the year it was laid down.

From the table:
- Laid down: 23 July 1759
- Launched: 7 May 1765

First, we calculate the time difference between these two dates:
- From 23 July 1759 to 31 December 1759: 188 days (since there are 31 days in July and 30 days in November, plus all of December)
- From 1 January 1760 to 31 December 1764: 5 years
- From 1 January 1765 to 7 May 1765: 127 days (since there are 31 days in January, 28 days in February, 31 days in March, 30 days in April, and 7 days in May)

Adding these together:
188 days + 5 years + 127 days = 5 years + (188 + 127) days

Since 365 days make up one year, we convert the extra days into years:
(188 + 127) days = 315 days
315 days ÷ 365 days/year ≈ 0.8637 years

So, the total time difference is approximately 5.8637 years. Rounding to the nearest whole number gives us 6 years.

","To determine how many years after being laid down the I-179 was completed, we need to calculate the difference between its completion date and its laying down date.

1. Laying down date: 21 August 1941
2. Completion date: 18 June 1943

We will convert these dates into years and months to accurately calculate the difference.

For 21 August 1941:
- 1941 is the full year
- 8 months (August to June of the next year)

For 18 June 1943:
- 1943 is the full year
- 6 months (June)

Now, let's find the difference:
- Years: 1943 - 1941 = 2 years
- Months: 6 months (18 June 1943) - 8 months (21 August 1941) = -2 months

Since we have negative months, we need to adjust:
- 2 years - 1 year = 1 year
- 12 months + (-2 months) = 10 months

Therefore, the I-179 was completed 2 years after it was laid down.

   - 2000 to 2009 = 10 years

4. Add the partial year:
   - From March 1997 to August 2010 includes 5 months of 2010.
   - Since 2010 is fully counted, we don't need to add any extra months.

Therefore, the total time from order to commissioning is 13 years.

","To determine how many years after being ordered HMS Victory was launched, we need to calculate the difference between the launch date and the order date.

1. Order date: 14 July 1758
2. Launch date: 7 May 1765

First, we find the difference in years:
- From 14 July 1758 to 31 December 1758: 5 months and 17 days
- From 1 January 1759 to 7 May 1765: 4 years and 4 months

Adding these together:
- 4 years + 4 months + 5 months and 17 days = 4 years and 9 months and 17 days

Since the exact month and day are not needed for the year calculation, we can simplify this to:
- 4 years and 9 months ≈ 5 years (since 9 months is close to a full year)

Therefore, HMS Victory was launched approximately 7 years after it was ordered.

","To determine how many years after its first battle HMS Victory fought at Trafalgar, we need to find the dates of these battles and calculate the difference.

1. First Battle of Ushant took place in 1778.
2. Battle of Trafalgar took place in 1805.

Next, we calculate the difference between these years:
3. 1805 - 1778 = 27 years.

Therefore, HMS Victory fought at Trafalgar 27 years after its first battle.

","To determine how many years after the I-179 was laid down it was completed, we need to calculate the difference between its completion date and the date it was laid down.

1. Laid down date: 21 August 1941
2. Completed date: 18 June 1943

Now, let's find the difference between these dates:

From 21 August 1941 to 31 December 1941: 
- 21 August to 31 December = 121 days

From 1 January 1942 to 31 December 1942: 
- 12 months = 365 days

From 1 January 1943 to 18 June 1943: 
- 18 June = 167 days

Adding these together:
121 days + 365 days + 167 days = 653 days

Since there are approximately 365 days in a year, we divide the total days by 365 to get the number of years:
653 days ÷ 365 days/year ≈ 1.8 years

Therefore, the I-179 was completed about 1.8 years after it was laid down.

","To determine how many years after the Islamic Coalition the party was dissolved, we need to follow these steps:

1. Identify when the Islamic Republican Party was founded.
2. Identify when it was dissolved.
3. Identify when the Islamic Coalition was established.
4. Calculate the time difference between the dissolution of the Islamic Republican Party and the establishment of the Islamic Coalition.

From the table:
1. The Islamic Republican Party was founded on 17 February 1979.
2. The party was dissolved on 1 June 1987.
3. The table does not explicitly mention when the Islamic Coalition was established. However, it states that the Islamic Republican Party was part of the Islamic Coalition until 1980. Therefore, we can assume the Islamic Coalition was established around this time.

Since the exact date of the Islamic Coalition's establishment is not given, we will use the closest available information, which is 1980.

Now, calculate the time difference:
- The party was dissolved on 1 June 1987.
- We assume the Islamic Coalition was established around 1980.

1987 - 1980 = 7 years

Therefore, the Islamic Republican Party was dissolved 7 years after the Islamic Coalition was established.

The party was founded on 17 February 1979.
The party was dissolved on 1 June 1987.

First, let's find the difference in years:
1987 - 1979 = 8 years

Next, we need to account for the difference in months and days:
From 17 February 1979 to 31 December 1979 = 11 months and 14 days
From 1 January 1987 to 1 June 1987 = 5 months and 1 day

Since the party was still in existence at the end of 1979 (even though only a few months), and it was dissolved in June 1987, the full years between these dates are indeed 8 years.

2. Identify the peak strength of the Sudanese Armed Forces: 36,000 (late 1971).
3. Calculate the difference in years between the start date and the peak strength date.

Let's calculate the difference:
- Start date: 18 August 1955
- Peak strength date: Late 1971

From 1955 to 1971 is 16 years. Since the peak strength occurred in late 1971, it is within the same year as 1971.

Therefore, the Sudanese Armed Forces reached their greatest strength 16 years after the beginning of the war.

","First, we need to identify when Fatah began its operations and when Syria became an ally of Fatah - The Revolutionary Council.

From the table, the dates of operation for Fatah - The Revolutionary Council are listed as 1974 - 1997. Therefore, Fatah began its operations in 1974.

The table also shows that Syria became an ally of Fatah - The Revolutionary Council during the period 1979-1985.

To find out how many years after Fatah began its operations Syria became an ally, we subtract the start year of Fatah's operations from the start year of Syria's alliance with Fatah - The Revolutionary Council.

1979 (Syria's alliance start year) - 1974 (Fatah's operation start year) = 5 years

Therefore, Syria became an ally 5 years after the operation of Fatah began.

","First, we need to identify when Fatah's operations ended. According to the table, Fatah - The Revolutionary Council operated from 1974 to 1997. So, it ended in 1997.

Next, we look at when Iraq was an ally. The table indicates that Iraq was an ally from 1974-1978 and again from 1991-2002. Since Fatah's operations ended in 1997, we focus on the period after 1997, which would be the second alliance with Iraq (1991-2002).

To find out how many years after Fatah's operations ended Iraq remained an ally, we calculate the difference between 2002 (end of Iraq's alliance with Fatah) and 1997 (end of Fatah's operations):
2002 - 1997 = 5 years

Therefore, Iraq remained an ally 5 years after the operation of Fatah ended.

","To determine how many years after the ordering of HMS Argyll it was launched, we need to find the difference between the launch date and the order date.

1. The ship was ordered in September 1986.
2. The ship was launched on 8 April 1989.

Now, calculate the difference:

From September 1986 to April 1989:
- From September 1986 to December 1986: 3 months
- Full years from 1987 to 1988: 2 years
- From January 1989 to April 1989: 4 months

Adding these together:
3 months + 2 years + 4 months = 2 years and 7 months

Since the question asks for the number of years, we can round this to 2 years.

","To determine how many years after the start of the insurgency Vietnam began supporting Laos, we need to identify the start date of the insurgency and the year Vietnam started supporting Laos.

1. **Start Date of the Insurgency**: The table states the date as ""2 December 1975 - present"".
2. **Year Vietnam Started Supporting Laos**: According to the table, ""Vietnam (from 1976)"" supported Laos.

Next, we calculate the difference between these two dates:
- Start of insurgency: 2 December 1975
- Vietnam's support began: 1976

Since Vietnam's support began in 1976, which is the year immediately following the start of the insurgency, the difference is 1 year.

","To determine how many years ago the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) were defeated, we need to use the information provided about their dates of operation.

From the table, we see that the LTTE operated from ""5 May 1976 – 18 May 2009"". The LTTE was militarily defeated on 18 May 2009.

Given that the current date is December 2022, we can calculate the number of years since their defeat:

1. First, calculate the difference in years:
   - 2022 - 2009 = 13 years

2. Check if there are any remaining months or days to adjust the calculation:
   - Since the defeat happened on 18 May 2009 and the current date is December 2022, we do not need to make any further adjustments as December is later in the year than May.

Therefore, the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam were defeated 13 years ago.

","To determine how many years are between Jacques Anquetil's first and last medal wins, we need to identify the years of these wins from the given information.

1. **First Medal Win**: 
   - According to the ""Olympic Games"" section, Anquetil won a bronze medal in the Team Time Trial event at the 1952 Helsinki Olympic Games.

2. **Last Medal Win**: 
   - From the ""World Championships"" section, Anquetil won a silver medal in the Road Race event at the 1966 Nürburgring World Championships.

Next, we calculate the difference in years between these two events:
- First medal win: 1952
- Last medal win: 1966

\[ 1966 - 1952 = 14 \]

Therefore, there are 14 years between Jacques Anquetil's first and last medal wins.

We calculate the difference between these two dates:
- From 13 July 1974 to 31 December 1974 = 5 months and 18 days.
- From 1 January 1975 to 19 June 1986 = 16 years and 6 months.

Adding these periods together:
- 5 months and 18 days + 16 years and 6 months = 17 years and 1 month and 18 days.

Since we are asked for the number of years, we round down to the nearest whole year:
17 years.

","To determine how many years before his retirement Daisuke Shiga achieved his highest rank, we need to follow these steps:

1. Identify when Daisuke Shiga achieved his highest rank.
2. Identify when he retired.
3. Calculate the difference in years between these two dates.

From the table:
- Daisuke Shiga achieved his highest rank as Ōzeki in January 2002.
- He retired in May 2007.

Now, calculate the difference:
- From January 2002 to May 2007:

","To determine how many years before the commissioning of HMS Argyll it was laid down, we need to find the difference between the commissioning date and the laid-down date.

1. Commissioned date: 31 May 1991
2. Laid down date: 20 March 1987

First, let's calculate the difference in years:
- From 1987 to 1991 is 4 years.

Next, we need to account for the difference in months:
- 31 May 1991 - 20 March 1987

Since 20 March 1987 is earlier than 31 May 1991, we can break this down into:
- From 20 March 1987 to 31 December 1987: 9 months
- From 1 January 1988 to 31 May 1991: 16 months and 30 days

Adding these together:
9 months + 16 months + 30 days = 25 months

Now, convert 25 months to years and months:
- 25 months = 2 years and 1 month

So, the total time from the laid-down date to the commissioning date is:
4 years (from 1987 to 1991) + 2 years and 1 month = 6 years and 1 month

Therefore, HMS Argyll was laid down 6 years before its commissioning.

","From the information given in the table, we can see that Southern Rhodesia participated until 1953, and the Emergency ended on 31 July 1960. To find out how many years before the end of the Emergency Southern Rhodesia ceased being a belligerent, we need to calculate the difference between these two dates.

First, let's determine the exact number of years:
- The Emergency ended on 31 July 1960.
- Southern Rhodesia ceased being a belligerent in 1953.

Subtracting the year Southern Rhodesia ceased from the year the Emergency ended:
1960 - 1953 = 7 years

Therefore, Southern Rhodesia ceased being a belligerent 7 years before the end of the Emergency.

This indicates that Southern Rhodesia, under the name Zimbabwe Rhodesia, continued its involvement until the end of the war in 1979. Therefore, Southern Rhodesia did not cease being a belligerent before the war ended; it was still involved at the end.

Final Answer: 0 years (Southern Rhodesia was still a belligerent at the end of the war in 1979.)"

","To determine how many years before the war ended the Republic of the Congo stopped being a belligerent, we need to follow these steps:

1. Identify the start and end dates of the war.
2. Determine when the Republic of the Congo stopped participating.
3. Calculate the difference in years between the end of the war and when the Republic of the Congo ceased participation.

From the information given:
- The war started on 5 July 1960 and ended on 25 November 1965.
- According to the table, the Republic of the Congo was a belligerent from 1960 to 1963.

The war ended on 25 November 1965, and the Republic of the Congo stopped being a belligerent in 1963. 

Now, calculate the difference:
1965 (end of the war) - 1963 (when Republic of the Congo stopped being a belligerent) = 2 years.

Therefore, the Republic of the Congo stopped being a belligerent 2 years before the war ended.

","To determine how many years Don Bradman played for the national side, we need to look at his Test debut and last Test dates.

- Bradman's Test debut was on 30 November 1928.
- His last Test was on 18 August 1948.

Now, let's calculate the difference in years:

1. From 30 November 1928 to 31 December 1928: 1 month (approximately 1/12th of a year)
2. From 1 January 1929 to 31 December 1947: 19 full years
3. From 1 January 1948 to 18 August 1948: 7 months (approximately 7/12th of a year)

Adding these up:
\[ \frac{1}{12} + 19 + \frac{7}{12} = \frac{1+7}{12} + 19 = \frac{8}{12} + 19 = \frac{2}{3} + 19 \approx 19.67 \]

Since we typically round to whole years in this context, we can say that Don Bradman played for the national side for approximately 19 or 20 years.

","To determine how many years Sachin Tendulkar played for the national side, we need to look at his Test and ODI debut dates and his last appearances.

- Test debut: 15 November 1989
- Last Test: 14 November 2013
- ODI debut: 18 December 1989
- Last ODI: 18 March 2012

We calculate the duration by subtracting the debut date from the last appearance date for both formats.

For Tests:
2013 - 1989 = 24 years

For ODIs:
2012 - 1989 = 23 years

Since the question asks about his time on the national side, we consider both formats together. However, if we need to specify a single number, we can use the longer duration, which is 24 years for Tests.

2. From 1 January 1995 to 20 September 1996

For the first part:

  - July: 31 days
  - August: 31 days
  - September: 30 days

  - 1995: 365 days
  - 1996: 366 days (leap year)
  - From 1 January to 20 September 1996:

1. Order date: March 1997
2. Launch date: June 8, 2007

First, let's find the difference in years:

- From March 1997 to March 2007 is exactly 10 years.
- From March 2007 to June 8, 2007, is 3 months and 8 days.

Since the question asks for the number of years, we can consider the full years:

10 years.

","To determine how many years the Tonnerre sailed before it was burned down, we need to find the difference between its commissioning date and the date it was burned.

1. Commissioned: 21 July 1808
2. Burned: 12 April 1809

First, calculate the time from 21 July 1808 to 31 December 1808:
- From 21 July to 31 December: 
  - July: 14 days (31 - 21 + 1)
  - August: 31 days
  - September: 30 days
  - October: 31 days
  - November: 30 days
  - December: 31 days
- Total: 14 + 31 + 30 + 31 + 30 + 31 = 167 days

Next, calculate the time from 1 January 1809 to 12 April 1809:
- January: 31 days
- February: 28 days (not a leap year)
- March: 31 days
- April: 12 days
- Total: 31 + 28 + 31 + 12 = 102 days

Now, add the days together:
- 167 days (from 21 July to 31 December 1808) + 102 days (from 1 January to 12 April 1809) = 269 days

Convert days to years:
- 269 days / 365 days per year ≈ 0.737 years

Since the ship was burned in the same calendar year, we can round this to one year for simplicity.

End year = 1979

Step 3: Calculate the duration by subtracting the start year from the end year.
Duration = End year - Start year
Duration = 1979 - 1965
Duration = 14 years

Therefore, the Chadian Civil War lasted 14 years.

","To determine the number of years between Merckx's first General Classification win and his last Combination Classification win at the Tour de France, we need to identify the specific years for both achievements.

From the ""Major wins"" section, we can see:
- Merckx won the General Classification at the Tour de France in 1969, 1970, 1971, 1972, and 1974. 
- For the Combination Classification, the years mentioned are 1969, 1970, 1971, 1972, and 1974.

The earliest General Classification win was in 1969.
The latest Combination Classification win was also in 1974.

Now, we calculate the difference between these years:
1974 - 1969 = 5 years

Therefore, the number of years that elapsed between Merckx's first General Classification win and his last Combination Classification win at the Tour de France is 5 years.

","To determine the number of years that elapsed between the laying down and the launching of the Tonnerre, we need to find the difference between the dates when it was laid down and when it was launched.

From the table:
- Laid down: 22 September 1794
- Launched: 9 June 1808

First, calculate the difference in years:
1808 - 1794 = 14 years

Next, check if there are any months or days that need adjustment:
- From 22 September 1794 to 31 December 1794: 4 months and 9 days
- From 1 January 1808 to 9 June 1808: 5 months and 9 days

Since the period spans across the full 14 years without needing further adjustment, the total elapsed time is 14 years.

2. **National Vanguard**: The table indicates that National Vanguard operated from 1960-1976.

Next, we calculate the duration of New Order's involvement before the National Vanguard joined in 1960:

- New Order started in 1957.
- National Vanguard joined in 1960.

Therefore, the calculation is:
\[ 1960 - 1957 = 3 \]

So, the New Order had been fighting for 3 years when the National Vanguard joined.

","To determine how many years longer the Arab Socialist Ba'ath Party has existed compared to its paramilitary wing, we need to find the founding dates of both the party and the paramilitary wing.

From the table:
- The Arab Socialist Ba'ath Party was founded on 7 April 1947.
- The paramilitary wing, Ba'ath Brigades, operated from 2012 to 2018.

First, calculate the duration of existence for each:
- The Arab Socialist Ba'ath Party has been in existence since 1947 to the current date (December 2022).
  Duration = 2022 - 1947 = 75 years.

- The Ba'ath Brigades operated from 2012 to 2018.
  Duration = 2018 - 2012 = 6 years.

Now, subtract the duration of the paramilitary wing from the duration of the party:
75 years - 6 years = 69 years.

Final Answer: The Arab Socialist Ba'ath Party has existed 69 years longer than its paramilitary wing."

","To find out how many years passed between the laying down and the launch of the Tonnerre, we need to calculate the difference between the year it was laid down and the year it was launched.

From the table:
- Laid down: 22 September 1794
- Launched: 9 June 1808

First, let's determine the full years between 1794 and 1808:
- From 1794 to 1808 is 14 years.

Next, we need to account for the months. Since the ship was laid down in September 1794 and launched in June 1808, we need to consider the time span from September 1794 to June 1808:
- From September 1794 to June 1808 includes all of 1794, 1795, 1796, 1797, 1798, 1799, 1800, 1801, 1802, 1803, 1804, 1805, 1806, 1807, and part of 1808.

Therefore, the exact time span is 13 full years plus the period from September 1794 to June 1808, which is less than a full year but more than half a year. Thus, we can conclude that the time span is effectively 13 years and 9 months.

However, since the question asks for the number of years, we will round this to the nearest whole number, which is 13 years.

","To determine how many years Aminishiki Ryūji was involved in sumo before retiring, we need to find the difference between his retirement date and his debut date.

Debut: January, 1997
Retirement: July, 2019

Calculating the years:
From January 1997 to December 1997 = 1 year
From January 1998 to December 1998 = 1 year
...
From January 2018 to December 2018 = 1 year
From January 2019 to June 2019 = 0.5 years

Adding these up:
19 years (from 1997 to 2018) + 0.5 years (January to June 2019) = 19.5 years

Therefore, Aminishiki Ryūji was involved in sumo for 19.5 years before retiring.

","To determine how many years Futabayama Sadaji was actively involved in his sport, we need to calculate the difference between the year he retired and the year he made his debut.

Debut: March 1927
Retired: November 1945

First, we find the difference in years between the retirement and debut:
1945 - 1927 = 18 years

Then, we need to consider the months to ensure accuracy. From March 1927 to November 1945 includes all of 1927, 1928, 1929, 1930, 1931, 1932, 1933, 1934, 1935, 1936, and 1937 plus part of 1938, 1939, 1940, 1941, 1942, 1943, 1944, and 1945 up to November.

This adds up to 18 full years plus the time from March 1927 to November 1945, which is approximately 2 more years.

Therefore, the total duration of his active involvement is 18 + 2 = 20 years.

* Up to date as of Nov 29, 2017.

","To determine the number of years between Harumafuji Kōhei's debut and his retirement, we need to calculate the difference between his retirement date and his debut date.

1. Debut date: January 2001
2. Retirement date: November 29, 2017

We can break this down into full years and the remaining days:
- From January 2001 to December 2017 is 17 full years.
- From January 1 to November 29, 2017, is approximately 10 months and 29 days, which is less than another full year.

Therefore, the total number of years between his debut and retirement is 17 years.

","To determine how many years the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) were active in Sri Lanka, we need to calculate the difference between their start date and end date.

Start Date: 5 May 1976
End Date: 18 May 2009

First, let's break down the time period into years and days:

1. From 5 May 1976 to 31 December 1976: 
   6 months and 27 days

2. From 1 January 1977 to 31 December 2008: 
   31 years

3. From 1 January 2009 to 18 May 2009: 
   4 months and 18 days

Adding these periods together:
- 6 months + 31 years + 4 months = 31 years + 10 months
- Converting 10 months into years: 10/12 ≈ 0.833 years
- Total years: 31 + 0.833 ≈ 31.833 years

Since the question asks for the number of years they were active, we can round this to the nearest whole number.

","To determine the number of years between when HMS Argyll was ordered and commissioned, we need to find the difference between the dates of these events.

1. HMS Argyll was ordered on September 1986.
2. HMS Argyll was commissioned on May 1991.

Now, calculate the difference:

From September 1986 to September 1991 is exactly 5 years.
From September 1991 to May 1991 is 7 months (September, October, November, December, January, February, March, April, and May).

Therefore, the total time from ordering to commissioning is 5 years and 7 months.

However, since the question asks for the number of years, we will consider only the full years.

","To determine how many years someone who is 8 years old would need to wait before serving in the Federal Defence Forces of Germany, we need to look at the military age and conscription status.

1. Military age: 17 years old
2. Conscription: Yes, but indefinitely suspended since July 2011

Since conscription is indefinitely suspended, the person must volunteer to serve.

3. Current minimum age for voluntary service: 17 years old

The person is currently 8 years old, so we calculate the difference between the current age and the minimum age for voluntary service:

17 (minimum age) - 8 (current age) = 9 years

Therefore, the person would need to wait 9 years before they could potentially serve in the Federal Defence Forces of Germany.

- He played for Laren from 2005 to 2006.
- So, the total time spent at Laren is 2006 - 2005 = 1 year.

Now, let's find the difference in years:
- Since the exact starting year for Club Egara before 2005 is not specified, we can only consider the period from 2021 to the current year (2022).
- Thus, the time spent at Club Egara from 2021 to 2022 is 2022 - 2021 = 1 year.

However, considering the ongoing nature of his stay at Club Egara, we should count the entire period from before 2005 to the current year (2022).

So, the total years at Club Egara would be approximately 2022 - 2005 + 1 (for the incomplete year) = 18 years.

Difference in years:
18 years (Club Egara) - 1 year (Laren) = 17 years.

","To determine how old Ali Farag was when he won his first team gold at the World Team Championships, we need to follow these steps:

1. Identify the first World Team Championship gold medal he won.
2. Calculate his age at that time.

From the table, the first World Team Championship gold medal Ali Farag won was in 2017 in Marseille.

Next, we calculate his age in 2017:
- Ali Farag was born on 22 April 1992.
- The event took place in 2017.

Since his birthday in 1992 occurred before 2017, we can determine his age by subtracting his birth year from 2017:
\[ 2017 - 1992 = 25 \]

Therefore, Ali Farag was 25 years old when he won his first team gold at the World Team Championships in 2017.

* Up to date as of June 25, 2020.

","To determine how old Aminishiki Ryūji was during his debut, we need to calculate the difference between the year of his debut and his birth year, taking into account the month and day.

1. Aminishiki Ryūji's birth date is October 3, 1978.
2. His debut in sumo was in January 1997.

Since his debut was in January and he was already born in October of the previous year, we can directly subtract the birth year from the debut year to find his age at the time of his debut:

1997 - 1978 = 19 years

Therefore, Aminishiki Ryūji was 19 years old during his debut in sumo.

","To determine Aminishiki Ryūji's age at his sumo debut, we need to calculate the difference between his birth date and the date of his debut.

1. Aminishiki Ryūji's birth date: October 3, 1978
2. His debut date: January, 1997

Let's break it down month by month:

- From October 3, 1978, to December 31, 1978: 
  - October has 31 days, so from October 3 to October 31 = 28 days
  - November has 30 days
  - December has 31 days
  - Total = 28 + 30 + 31 = 89 days

- From January 1, 1997, to January 31, 1997:
  - January has 31 days

Adding the days together:
- Days before the debut: 89 days
- Days after the debut: 31 days
- Total days between the two dates: 89 + 31 = 120 days

Since 120 days is less than a year, we can conclude that Aminishiki Ryūji was 19 years old when he made his debut.

1. Aminishiki Ryūji's birth date: October 3, 1978
2. Aminishiki Ryūji's retirement date: July 2019

Since Aminishiki Ryūji retired in July 2019, we can calculate his age by subtracting his birth year from the year of retirement and adjusting for the month and day.

- Year difference: 2019 - 1978 = 41 years
- Since he had already passed his birthday (October 3) in 2019, he was still 41 years old when he retired in July 2019.

Therefore, Aminishiki Ryūji was 41 years old when he retired.

","To determine how old Brian Lara was when he first played for Trinidad and Tobago, we need to find the age at which he joined the national team. However, the table does not provide his age when he first played for the national team. Instead, it provides his age as of May 2, 1969, and his international debut dates.

Since his international debut was on 6 December 1990, we can calculate his age at that time:

1. His birthdate is May 2, 1969.
2. His debut was on December 6, 1990.

We need to calculate the difference in years between these two dates:
- From May 2, 1990, to December 6, 1990, is approximately 7 months and 4 days.
- Adding this to his age as of May 2, 1969 (which is 23 years and 0 months), we get approximately 24 years and 7 months.

Therefore, Brian Lara was about 24 years old when he first played for Team Trinidad and Tobago.

1. Bradman's Test debut was on 30 November 1928.
2. Bradman was born on 27 August 1908.

First, calculate the age as of the end of 1928:
- In 1928, Bradman would have turned 20 years old by the end of the year because he was born in 1908.

Next, since his debut was in November 1928, we need to check if he had already turned 20 before this date:
- By 27 August 1928, Bradman would have been 20 years old.
- Since 30 November 1928 is after 27 August 1928, he was still 20 years old at the time of his debut.

Therefore, Don Bradman was 20 years old when he made his first Test debut.

Bradman's Test debut was on 30 November 1928, and he was born on 27 August 1908.

First, let's calculate the age if both dates were in the same year:
- From August to November, there are about 3 months left in 1908.
- In 1928, it would be 20 years plus the additional 3 months.

Since he had not yet reached his birthday (27 August) in 1928, he was still 19 years old at the time of his Test debut.

Final Answer: Don Bradman was 19 years old when he made his international Test debut."

","To determine how old Jacques Anquetil was when he won the bronze medal in the 1952 Olympic Games Team Time Trial in Helsinki, we need to calculate his age based on the year of the event.

Anquetil was born on January 8, 1934. The 1952 Olympic Games took place in Helsinki, Finland.

First, we find the difference between 1952 and 1934:
1952 - 1934 = 18 years

Since the event occurred in 1952, and Anquetil would have been turning 18 during that year, we can conclude that he was 18 years old when he won the bronze medal in the 1952 Olympic Games.

","To determine how old Kaiō Hiroyuki was when he made his debut, we need to calculate the difference between the year of his debut and his birth year, taking into account the month and day as well.

From the table:
- Kaiō Hiroyuki's birth date is 24 July 1972.
- His debut date is March 1988.

Since his debut was in March and he was born in July, we know he had not yet reached his birthday in 1988. Therefore, we subtract his birth year from the debut year and subtract one year from the result.

Calculation:
1988 (debut year) - 1972 (birth year) = 16 years
Since he had not yet turned 16 by March 1988, we do not subtract an additional year.

Final Answer: Kaiō Hiroyuki was 16 years old when he made his debut."

","To determine how old Jorge Lombi was when he won gold at the Pan American Games, we need to identify the years he won gold medals and calculate his age based on his birth year (November 1, 1971).

1. **1995 Mar del Plata**: Lombi won a gold medal at the age of \(1995 - 1971 = 24\) years.
2. **1999 Winnipeg**: Lombi won a silver medal at the age of \(1999 - 1971 = 28\) years.
3. **2003 Santo Domingo**: Lombi won a gold medal at the age of \(2003 - 1971 = 32\) years.
4. **2007 Rio de Janeiro**: Lombi won a gold medal at the age of \(2007 - 1971 = 36\) years.

The question asks specifically about the gold medal win, and Lombi won gold medals in 1995, 2003, and 2007. We can choose any of these years, but since all are valid, we'll use the earliest gold medal win for simplicity.

Thus, Lombi was 24 years old when he won his first gold medal at the 1995 Mar del Plata Pan American Games.

","To determine Sachin Tendulkar's age when he played his last one-day match, we need to follow these steps:

1. Identify the date of his last ODI match.
2. Determine his age on that date.

From the table:
- Last ODI: 18 March 2012

Sachin Tendulkar was born on 24 April 1973. We need to calculate his age on 18 March 2012.

Since his birthday (24 April) is after the date of his last ODI match (18 March), we can conclude that he had not yet turned 39 by 18 March 2012.

To find his exact age, we can use the following calculation:
- From 1 January 2012 to 18 March 2012: 2 months and 18 days
- Age on 1 January 2012: 38 years (since he would have turned 39 on 24 April 2012)

Therefore, on 18 March 2012, Sachin Tendulkar was 38 years and 2 months and 18 days old.

Final Answer: Sachin Tendulkar was 38 years old when he played his last one-day match."

1. Identify the year Vettel won the United States Grand Prix.
2. Calculate his age based on his birth year.

From the table, we can see that Vettel's first win was at the 2008 Italian Grand Prix. However, there is no specific mention of him winning the United States Grand Prix in the given data. Therefore, I will assume the question refers to his first win, which was the 2008 Italian Grand Prix.

Vettel was born on July 3, 1987.

The 2008 Italian Grand Prix took place on September 28, 2008.

To calculate his age:
- Vettel turned 21 on July 3, 2008.
- From July 3 to September 28, 2008, he had been 21 for about 3 months and would turn 22 shortly after.

Therefore, Sebastian Vettel was 21 years old when he won the 2008 Italian Grand Prix.

","To determine the duration of the 1995 Atlantic hurricane season, we need to find out when it started and when it ended.

From the table:
- The first system formed on June 2, 1995.
- The last system dissipated on November 1, 1995.

Now, let's calculate the number of days:

1. From June 2 to November 1:
   - June has 30 days. So, from June 2 to June 30 is 29 days.
   - July has 31 days.
   - August has 31 days.
   - September has 30 days.
   - October has 31 days.
   - November 1 is 1 day.

2. Summing up these days:
   - June: 29 days
   - July: 31 days
   - August: 31 days
   - September: 30 days
   - October: 31 days
   - November: 1 day

   Total = 29 + 31 + 31 + 30 + 31 + 1 = 153 days

Therefore, the 1995 Atlantic hurricane season lasted over 153 days.

1. First system formed: June 8, 2005
2. Last system dissipated: January 6, 2006

We can break this down into parts:
- Days remaining in June 2005: June has 30 days, so from June 8 to June 30 is 23 days.
- Full months from July 2005 to December 2005: 6 months × 30 days/month = 180 days.
- Days in January 2006 up to January 6: 6 days.

Adding these together:

","To determine the longest period without a major military operation since the Israel Defense Forces' inception in 1948, we need to look at the listed historical operations and find the longest gap between them.

1. **1948 Arab-Israeli War** to **Sinai War** (1956): 9 years
2. **Sinai War** to **Six-Day War** (1967): 10 years
3. **Six-Day War** to **War of Attrition** (1970): 3 years
4. **War of Attrition** to **Yom Kippur War** (1973): 3 years
5. **Yom Kippur War** to **Operation Litani** (1978): 5 years
6. **Operation Litani** to **First Lebanon War** (1982): 4 years
7. **First Lebanon War** to **South Lebanon conflict** (2000): 18 years
8. **South Lebanon conflict** to **First Intifada** (1987): 7 years
9. **First Intifada** to **Second Intifada** (2000): 2 years
10. **Second Intifada** to **Second Lebanon War** (2006): 6 years
11. **Second Lebanon War** to **Operation Cast Lead** (2008): 2 years
12. **Operation Cast Lead** to **Pillar of Defense** (2012): 4 years
13. **Pillar of Defense** to **Protective Edge** (2014): 2 years
14. **Protective Edge** to **Guardian of the Walls** (2021): 7 years

From the above, the longest period without a major military operation is between the South Lebanon conflict (2000) and the First Intifada (1987), which is 18 years.

- Synodic period of Mars: 779.96 days or 2.1354 years
- Synodic period of Earth: 365.25 days or 1 year (approximately)

Now, calculate the difference:
2.1354 years - 1 year = 1.1354 years

","To determine the first year after 2005 with at least 31 total depressions, we need to look at the ""Total depressions"" column in the table. The table provides information about the 2005 Atlantic hurricane season and its statistics, but it does not list every year's statistics directly. Instead, it gives us a hint about other seasons by mentioning ""2003, 2004, 2005, 2006, 2007"" in the ""Atlantic hurricane seasons"" row.

Given that the 2005 season had 31 total depressions, we need to find the next year that matches or exceeds this number. The table does not provide exact numbers for each year, but it states that 2020 had a record high of 31 total depressions, tied with 2005.

Therefore, the first year after 2005 with at least 31 total depressions is 2020.

Atlantic hurricane seasons | 2003, 2004, | 2005 | , 2006, 2007

","To determine the year with the most Atlantic hurricanes, I'll look at the information provided in the table. Specifically, I'll focus on the ""Seasonal statistics"" section, which mentions ""Total storms"" and ""Hurricanes.""

From the table, we can see that the 2005 Atlantic hurricane season had 28 total storms and 15 hurricanes. This is compared to the other seasons listed but does not explicitly state how many storms those seasons had. However, since the question asks for the year with the most Atlantic hurricanes, and 2005 had 15 hurricanes, I need to compare this to other years mentioned in the context.

The table also provides information about the 2020 season, which had a record-high total of 31 depressions, 28 storms, and 15 hurricanes. Since the question asks specifically for the year with the most hurricanes, and 2020 had 15 hurricanes like 2005 but also had a higher number of total storms, it appears 2020 might have more hurricanes when considering the total number of storms.

However, the table directly states that 2005 had a record high for major hurricanes (7, tied with 2020), and it also had 15 hurricanes, which is the highest number shown for any single season in the given data.
