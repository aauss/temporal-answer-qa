","To determine approximately how many months after being apprehended Jeffrey Epstein died by suicide, we need to follow these steps:

1. Identify the date Epstein was apprehended:
   - According to the table, Epstein was apprehended on July 6, 2019.

2. Identify the date of his suicide:
   - The table states that Epstein died on August 10, 2019.

3. Calculate the time difference between these two dates:
   - From July 6 to August 10, we need to count the days:
     - July has 31 days, so from July 6 to July 31 is 26 days.
     - Adding the full month of August up to the 10th gives us another 10 days.
   - Total days = 26 + 10 = 36 days.

4. Convert the total days into months:
   - Since there are roughly 30 days in a month, 36 days is approximately 1.2 months.

Therefore, Jeffrey Epstein died by suicide approximately 1.2 months after being apprehended.

Final Answer: Approximately 1.2 months."

2. The table does provide information about Steve Austin, who has a similar name, but it doesn't mention any retirement age or the name Hebar Pazardzhik.

3. The table does show that Steve Austin retired on March 30, 2003, but this is not the original retirement date mentioned in the question.

4. The question specifically asks for the ""original"" retirement date, which isn't provided in the table.

5. We can calculate Steve Austin's age at his retirement in 2003:
   - Born on December 18, 1964
   - Retired on March 30, 2003
   - Age would be 38 years and 2 months old

Lead position ends	16 October 2023
Jurist term ends	6 October 2024

","To determine for how many more years Esther Hayut has been with the Supreme Court of Israel compared to Uzi Vogelman, we need to calculate the duration each has served.

Step 1: Calculate Esther Hayut's tenure.
- Esther Hayut became President on 26 October 2017.
- Her lead position ends on 16 October 2023.
- Duration = 2023 - 2017 = 6 years

Step 2: Calculate Uzi Vogelman's tenure.
- Uzi Vogelman became Deputy President on 9 May 2022.
- His lead position ends on 16 October 2023.
- To find the duration, we need to calculate from 9 May 2022 to 16 October 2023.
- From 9 May 2022 to 30 April 2023: 12 months
- From 1 May 2023 to 16 October 2023: 5 months
- Total duration ≈ 12 + 5/12 ≈ 12.42 years or approximately 12 years (since we are looking at approximate years)

Step 3: Compare the durations.
- Esther Hayut: 6 years
- Uzi Vogelman: Approximately 12 years

Step 4: Calculate the difference.
- Difference = 12 - 6 = 6 years

Therefore, Esther Hayut has been with the Supreme Court of Israel for approximately 6 fewer years compared to Uzi Vogelman.

Final Answer: Uzi Vogelman has been with the Supreme Court of Israel for approximately 6 more years than Esther Hayut."

1. Benny McCoy's MLB debut was on September 14, 1938.
2. His last MLB appearance was on September 28, 1941.

Now, let's calculate the number of years between these two dates:

1. From September 14, 1938, to September 13, 1939, is exactly 1 year.
2. From September 13, 1939, to September 28, 1941, is 2 years.

Adding these together:
1 year + 2 years = 3 years

Therefore, Benny McCoy played professional baseball for 3 years.

Key dates
3 November 1863	Opened as | Black Dog Siding
8 June 1953	Renamed | Black Dog Halt
20 September 1965	Closed

","To determine how many years Black Dog Siding operated under its original name, we need to look at the key dates provided in the history section of the table.

1. The table states that Black Dog Siding was opened on ""3 November 1863"".
2. It was renamed to Black Dog Halt on ""8 June 1953"".

The period of operation under its original name (Black Dog Siding) would be from the opening date to the renaming date.

Let's calculate this:
- From 3 November 1863 to 8 June 1953.

We can break this down into full years:
- From 3 November 1863 to 31 December 1863 = about 3 months in 1863
- Full years from 1864 to 1952 = 1952 - 1864 + 1 = 89 years
- From 1 January 1953 to 8 June 1953 = about 5 months in 1953

Adding these together, we get approximately 89 years and 8 months. Since the question asks for the number of years, we can round this to 89 years.

Final Answer: Black Dog Siding operated under its original name for approximately 89 years."

Sainthood
Venerated in	Roman Catholic Church
Title as Saint	Venerable
Attributes	Bishop's attire

","To determine how many years Alphonse Gallegos served as both Auxiliary Bishop of Sacramento and Titular Bishop of Sasabe, we need to examine the information provided in the table:

1. **Titular Bishop of Sasabe**: The table shows that Gallegos held this position from 1981 to 1991.
2. **Auxiliary Bishop of Sacramento**: This title is mentioned in the ""Other post(s)"" section but does not specify a start or end date.

However, it's important to note that being appointed as Auxiliary Bishop typically implies a concurrent role with another diocesan position, often the Bishop of the primary see. Given that Gallegos was also the Bishop of Sacramento during this period, it's reasonable to infer that he held the role of Auxiliary Bishop concurrently with his role as Bishop of Sacramento.

Since the table doesn't explicitly state when Gallegos became Auxiliary Bishop, we can assume that his term as Auxiliary Bishop overlapped with his term as Bishop of Sacramento, which ended on 6 October 1991.

Therefore, based on the information given, Alphonse Gallegos served as both positions for the entire duration of his term as Bishop of Sacramento, which is 10 years (from 1981 to 1991).

Final Answer: Alphonse Gallegos served as both Auxiliary Bishop of Sacramento and Titular Bishop of Sasabe for 10 years."

- First flight date: 19 April 2021

Step 3: Calculate the difference in days.
- The difference between these two dates is 16 days.

Step 4: Convert the difference from days to months.
- Since there are approximately 30.44 days in a month (365 days / 12 months), we can convert 16 days to months:
  \[
  \frac{16 \text{ days}}{30.44 \text{ days/month}} \approx 0.524 \text{ months}
  \]

Step 5: Round to a reasonable precision.
- Rounding 0.524 to one decimal place gives us 0.5 months.

Therefore, it took approximately 0.5 months for Ingenuity to go from deployment to its first flight.

Final Answer: It took approximately 0.5 months for Ingenuity to go from deployment to its first flight."

Travelled	7.17 km (4.46 mi) on Mars as of 11 June 2022 | [update]

","To determine how long in months Ingenuity's first flight was from its last flight, we need to follow these steps:

1. Identify the dates of the first and last flights.
   - First flight: April 19, 2021
   - Last flight: June 11, 2022

2. Calculate the total duration in days:
   - From April 19, 2021, to April 30, 2021: 12 days
   - May 2021: 31 days
   - June 2021: 30 days
   - July 2021: 31 days
   - August 2021: 31 days
   - September 2021: 30 days
   - October 2021: 31 days
   - November 2021: 30 days
   - December 2021: 31 days
   - January 2022: 31 days
   - February 2022: 28 days
   - March 2022: 31 days
   - April 2022: 11 days (up to June 11, 2022)

   Total = 12 + 31 + 30 + 31 + 31 + 30 + 31 + 30 + 31 + 31 + 28 + 31 + 11 = 367 days

3. Convert the total days into months:
   - Since there are approximately 30.44 days in a month (365 days / 12 months),
     367 days ≈ 367 / 30.44 ≈ 12.05 months

Therefore, the time between Ingenuity's first and last flight is approximately 12 months.

","To answer this question, we need to follow these steps:

1. Identify when the Gaza-Israel conflict started.
2. Determine when Sudan ceased to be a belligerent.
3. Calculate the difference in years between these two events.

Step 1: The conflict started on June 28, 2006.

Step 2: From the ""Belligerents"" section, we can see that Sudan was listed as a supporter of Gaza until 2015.

Step 3: To calculate the number of years:
- Start date: June 28, 2006
- End date: 2015

We need to count the full years between these dates:
- 2007 - 2015 = 8 years

Therefore, Sudan ceased to be a belligerent 8 years after the start of the Gaza-Israel conflict.

","To determine how long Alojzije Mišić served as the Bishop of Mostar-Duvno, we need to look at the information provided in the table about his appointment and term end.

1. **Appointment Date**: The table shows that Alojzije Mišić was appointed on 29 April 1912.
2. **Term Ended**: The table also indicates that his term ended on 26 March 1942.

Now, let's calculate the duration of his service:

- From 29 April 1912 to 26 March 1942:
  - First, calculate the full years: 
    - 1912 to 1941 = 29 years
  - Then, account for partial years:
    - From 29 April 1912 to 31 December 1912 = 8 months (which doesn't count as a full year)
    - From 1 January 1942 to 26 March 1942 = 2 months + 26 days (which also doesn't count as a full year)

Since he started mid-year and ended mid-year, we can consider this as exactly 29 years of service.

Therefore, Alojzije Mišić served as the Bishop of Mostar-Duvno for 29 years.

Final Answer: 29 years."

Sainthood

","To determine how long Alphonse Gallegos served as Auxiliary Bishop of Sacramento, we need to identify the start and end dates of this position from the given information.

Step 1: Identify the start date.
The table provides information about his appointment as Bishop of Sacramento on 24 August 1981 and his term ending on 6 October 1991. However, it also mentions that he was a Titular Bishop of Sasabe from 1981-1991, which suggests he held multiple positions during this period.

Step 2: Identify the relevant information.
The specific mention of ""Auxiliary Bishop of Sacramento"" does not provide explicit dates. But, we can infer from the context that his role as Auxiliary Bishop of Sacramento would have started before or around the same time as his appointment as Bishop of Sacramento, as these positions are often concurrent.

Step 3: Use the term end date as a reference.
Since his term as Bishop of Sacramento ended on 6 October 1991, and there is no explicit mention of him leaving the Auxiliary Bishop role, we can reasonably assume he continued in the Auxiliary Bishop role until this date.

Step 4: Calculate the duration.
Given that he was appointed Bishop of Sacramento on 24 August 1981, and assuming he took up the Auxiliary Bishop role at the same time or shortly after, we calculate the duration of his service as Auxiliary Bishop of Sacramento from 24 August 1981 to 6 October 1991.

From 24 August 1981 to 6 October 1991:
- 1981: 3 months (August, September, and part of October)
- 1982: 12 months
- 1983: 12 months
- 1984: 12 months
- 1985: 12 months
- 1986: 12 months

- 1988: 12 months
- 1989: 12 months
- 1990: 12 months
- 1991: 2 months (January and February)

Adding these up gives us 10 full years plus 5 months.

Therefore, Alphonse Gallegos served as Auxiliary Bishop of Sacramento for approximately "

","To determine how long AT&T was known by a different name, we need to identify the periods during which it operated under different names.

1. **Southwestern Bell Corporation (1983-1995)**:
   - AT&T Inc. was formed on October 5, 1983.
   - It operated as Southwestern Bell Corporation from 1983 to 1995.
   - Duration: 1995 - 1983 = 12 years

2. **SBC Communications Inc. (1995-2005)**:
   - From 1995 to 2005, AT&T operated under the name SBC Communications Inc.
   - Duration: 2005 - 1995 = 10 years

Adding these durations together gives us the total time AT&T was known by a different name:

12 years + 10 years = 22 years

Final Answer: AT&T had been known by a different name for 22 years."

Salvadoran Civil War
Date	15 October 1979 - 16 January 1992 | (12 years, 3 months and 1 day)
Location	El Salvador
Result	Chapultepec Peace Accords | Restructuring of Salvadoran Armed Forces | National Police was replaced by National Civil Police; National Guard and Treasury Police are dissolved. | FMLN armed wing is dissolved, becoming solely a political party (although its combatants are exonerated).
['Part of the Central American crisis and Cold War', 'Clockwise: Guerrilla camp in Morazán in 1983; Salvadoran Armed Forces soldiers; Ronald Reagan and José Napoleón Duarte in 1985; The final offensive of 1981; Guerrillas in Perquín, Morazán in 1990. | Clockwise: Guerrilla camp in Morazán in 1983; Salvadoran Armed Forces soldiers; Ronald Reagan and José Napoleón Duarte in 1985; The final offensive of 1981; Guerrillas in Perquín, Morazán in 1990.']

","To determine how long the Salvadoran Civil War had been going on when North Korea withdrew diplomatic support, we need to follow these steps:

1. Identify when North Korea withdrew its support.
2. Calculate the duration of the war from the start date to that point.

Step 1: Identifying when North Korea withdrew support
From the table, under ""Diplomatic support,"" we see that North Korea provided support until 1990.

Step 2: Calculating the duration
The war started on 15 October 1979. We need to calculate the time between this date and 1990.

- From 15 October 1979 to 31 December 1979: 2 months and 16 days
- From 1 January 1980 to 31 December 1989: 10 full years
- From 1 January 1990 to 31 December 1990: 1 full year

Adding these up:
2 months and 16 days (1979) + 10 years (1980-1989) + 1 year (1990) = 11 years and 2 months and 16 days

Therefore, the Salvadoran Civil War had been going on for 11 years when North Korea withdrew its diplomatic support in 1990.

","To determine how long Belarus has been under its current Constitution, we need to follow these steps:

1. Identify when the current Constitution was adopted.
2. Determine the current year.
3. Calculate the difference between the current year and the adoption date.

Step 1: Identifying the adoption date
From the table, we can see that the ""Current constitution"" is listed as ""15 March 1994"".

Step 2: Determining the current year
The question doesn't specify a particular year, but it mentions the current date is December, 2022. Therefore, we will use 2022 as our reference year.

2022 - 1994 = 28 years

Therefore, Belarus has been under its current Constitution for 28 years.

Final Answer: Belarus has been under its current Constitution for 28 years."

Step 4: Verify the exact number of years.
Since the university was established on October 9, 1701, and the current year is 2022, it has indeed been 321 years since its establishment. The year 2021 would have marked 320 years, but 2022 adds one more full year.

- The church was founded in the 13th century, which is around 1200 AD.
- It was consecrated on 31 July 1949.
- The duration of this period is from 1200 to 1949.

\[ 1949 - 1200 = 749 \text{ years} \]

### 2. Closed Period (1873 to 1949):
- The church was closed from 1873 to 1949.
- Duration of closure: 
\[ 1949 - 1873 = 76 \text{ years} \]

### 3. Current Operation:
- The church is currently active since 1949.
- As of December 2022, the duration of current operation is:
\[ 2022 - 1949 = 73 \text{ years} \]

### Total Duration of Operation:
Summing up all the operational periods:
\[ 749 \text{ years} + 73 \text{ years} = 822 \text{ years} \]

Thus, the church has been open in total for 822 years.

Final Answer: The church has been open in total for 822 years."

","To determine how long the current AT&T logo has been in use, we need to identify when the current logo was introduced. However, the information provided does not explicitly state when the current logo was introduced. 

The table provides some historical context:
- The company was founded on October 5, 1983.
- It has gone through various name changes and acquisitions since then.

Without specific information about the introduction of the current logo, we can only infer based on the most recent significant changes. The image caption mentions ""AT&THQDallas.jpg,"" which likely refers to the current logo given that it shows the corporate headquarters. However, this still doesn't provide a clear year of introduction.

Given the lack of specific information in the provided table, we cannot accurately determine the exact number of years the current logo has been in use.

","To determine how long Alojzije Mišić served as the Bishop of Mostar-Duvno and Apostolic Administrator of Trebinje-Mrkan, we need to identify the start and end dates of his term in this position.

1. **Identifying the Start Date:**
   - The table provides the ""Appointed"" date for this position, which is 29 April 1912.

2. **Identifying the End Date:**
   - The table also provides the ""Term ended"" date for this position, which is 26 March 1942.

3. **Calculating the Duration:**
   - To find the duration, we subtract the start year from the end year:
     \[
     1942 - 1912 = 30 \text{ years}
     \]
   - However, since the term ended on 26 March 1942, it means he had not completed his 30th year in office. Therefore, the exact duration is less than 30 years.

4. **Breaking Down the Remaining Days:**
   - From 29 April 1912 to 26 March 1942:
     - From 29 April 1912 to 31 December 1912: \( 9 months \)
     - From 1 January 1913 to 31 December 1941: \( 30 years \)
     - From 1 January 1942 to 26 March 1942: \( 2 months + 26 days \)

   - Adding these together:
     \[
     9 \text{ months} + 30 \text{ years} + 2 \text{ months} + 26 \text{ days} = 30 \text{ years and } 11 \text{ months and } 26 \text{ days}
     \]

Therefore, Alojzije Mišić served as the Bishop of Mostar-Duvno and Apostolic Administrator of Trebinje-Mrkan for 30 years, 11 months, and 26 days.

","To determine how long Arnold Schwarzenegger served as the Governor of California, we need to look at the dates provided in the table.

1. In office: November 17, 2003 - January 3, 2011
2. Calculate the difference between these two dates:
   - From November 17, 2003, to January 3, 2011

Let's break it down:
- From November 17, 2003, to December 31, 2003: 1 month + 15 days = 1.5 months
- From January 1, 2011, to January 3, 2011: 2 days

So, the total time in months is approximately 10 months and 2 days.

Since we need the answer in years, we convert 10 months and 2 days into years:
- 10 months is roughly 10/12 = 0.8333 years
- 2 days is negligible in this context

Therefore, the total time as governor is approximately 0.8333 years, but since the question asks for years, we can round this to the nearest whole number.

Final Answer: Arnold Schwarzenegger served as the Governor of California for about 7 years. However, if we strictly follow the given dates, he served for slightly more than 1 year. Given the options and the need for a clear answer, we'll state it as 1 year."

1. **Identify José Manuel de Herrera's Role**:
   - The table lists José Manuel de Herrera as the Emperor for the period 1822-1823.

2. **Find the Prime Minister's Information**:
   - The table provides a list of government structures but does not explicitly mention José Manuel de Herrera as a Prime Minister.
   - However, the question asks specifically about his tenure as Prime Minister, so we should look for any information related to his role as such.

3. **Examine the Government Structure**:
   - The table mentions a ""Provisional Government Junta"" from 1821-1822.
   - It also mentions a ""National Institutional Junta"" from 1822-1823.
   - These junta roles could potentially include a Prime Minister or similar position.

4. **Assess the Information**:
   - There is no explicit mention of José Manuel de Herrera being a Prime Minister.
   - The table does not provide a clear timeline for his specific role as Prime Minister.

5. **Conclusion**:
   - Given the limited information and the lack of a direct statement about José Manuel de Herrera serving as Prime Minister, we cannot accurately determine the duration of his tenure based on the provided data.

Since the table does not provide clear information about José Manuel de Herrera's role as Prime Minister and the exact dates he held this position, we must conclude that the information needed to answer the question is insufficient.

Final Answer: The information provided in the table is insufficient to determine the exact number of years José Manuel de Herrera served as Prime Minister of the Mexican Empire."

1. **Start Date**: The table indicates that Mišić was appointed on 29 April 1912 and installed on 14 July 1912. We can consider the installation date as the official start of his term, which is 14 July 1912.

   Adding these up:
   - Total months: 5 + 12 * 31 + 2 = 380 months

","To determine how long the Birmingham-Jefferson Convention Complex was open before its renovation in 2009, we need to follow these steps:

1. Identify when the complex was opened.
2. Identify when it was renovated.
3. Calculate the difference between these two dates.

From the information provided:
1. The complex was opened in January 1972.
2. It was renovated in 2009.

Now, let's calculate the duration:

- From 1972 to 2009 is a span of 37 years.
- However, since renovations typically occur after the structure has been open for some time, we should consider if any partial years should be included.

Since the complex was opened in January 1972 and the first renovation began in 2009, there is no need to include partial years. The full 37-year period from opening to the start of the first major renovation is accurate.

Therefore, the Birmingham-Jefferson Convention Complex was open for 37 years before it was renovated in 2009.

Final Answer: 37 years"

[""Consolidated PBV-1A Catalina '433915' Miss Pick Up (G-PBYA).jpg"", 'A restored OA-10 Catalina in US Army Air Corps colors']

","To determine how long the PBY Catalina was in commission by the U.S. Navy, we need to find the period between its introduction and retirement by the U.S. Navy.

1. From the table, we see that the PBY Catalina was introduced in October 1936 by the United States Navy.
2. The table also shows that it was retired in January 1957 by the United States Navy Reserve. However, since the U.S. Navy Reserve is part of the broader U.S. Navy, we can use this date for our calculation.
3. To calculate the duration, we subtract the start year from the end year:
   - Start year: 1936
   - End year: 1957
4. Calculation: 1957 - 1936 = 21 years

Therefore, the PBY Catalina was in commission by the U.S. Navy for 21 years.

","To determine how many days after being laid down INS Trishul was launched, we need to calculate the difference between the launch date and the laid-down date.

Step 1: Identify the dates.
- Laid down: 24 September 1999
- Launched: 24 November 1999

Step 2: Calculate the number of days between these dates.
- From 24 September to 30 September: 6 days
- October has 31 days, so from 1 October to 31 October: 31 days
- From 1 November to 24 November: 24 days

Step 3: Sum the days.
6 + 31 + 24 = 61 days

Therefore, INS Trishul was launched 61 days after it was laid down.

","To determine how many days after the groundbreaking on July 11, 1939, the construction of All Hallows Twickenham was completed, we need to follow these steps:

1. Identify the groundbreaking date: July 11, 1939.
2. Identify the consecration date: November 9, 1940.
3. Calculate the difference between these two dates.

Let's break down the calculation:

- From July 11, 1939, to December 31, 1939:
  - July: 21 days (from July 11 to July 31)
  - August: 31 days
  - September: 30 days
  - October: 31 days
  - November: 30 days
  - December: 31 days

Total for 1939: 21 + 31 + 30 + 31 + 30 + 31 = 174 days

- From January 1, 1940, to November 9, 1940:
  - January: 31 days
  - February: 28 days (1940 is not a leap year)
  - March: 31 days
  - April: 30 days
  - May: 31 days
  - June: 30 days
  - July: 31 days
  - August: 31 days
  - September: 30 days
  - October: 31 days
  - November: 9 days

Total for 1940 up to November 9: 31 + 28 + 31 + 30 + 31 + 30 + 31 + 31 + 30 + 31 + 9 = 311 days

Adding these together:
174 days (1939) + 311 days (1940 up to Nov 9) = 485 days

Therefore, the construction was completed 485 days after the groundbreaking on July 11, 1939.

Final Answer: 485 days."

- Start date: 12 September 1974
- End date: 28 May 1991

Step 2: Calculate the number of years between these dates.
- From 1974 to 1991 is 16 full years.

Step 3: Calculate the remaining days for each partial year.
- From 12 September 1974 to 31 December 1974: 100 days (30 + 31 + 30)
- From 1 January 1991 to 28 May 1991: 149 days (31 + 28 + 31 + 30 + 31)

Step 4: Sum up all the days.
- Full years: 16 years * 365 days/year = 5840 days
- Remaining days: 100 + 149 = 249 days
- Total days: 5840 + 249 = 6089 days

The table also provides the exact duration in more detail: ""16 years, 8 months, 3 weeks and 2 days"". To verify:
- 16 years = 5840 days
- 8 months = approximately 248 days (8 * 30.25, assuming average month length)
- 3 weeks = 21 days
- 2 days

Adding these together:
5840 + 248 + 21 + 2 = 6111 days

Therefore, the Ethiopian Civil War lasted 6111 days.

Final Answer: The Ethiopian Civil War lasted 6111 days."

","To determine how many months after the Plan of Iguala Mexican independence occurred, we need to follow these steps:

1. Identify the dates from the information provided:
   - Plan of Iguala: 24 February 1821
   - Independence of Mexico: 28 September 1821

2. Calculate the time difference between these two dates:
   - From 24 February to 28 February: 4 days
   - March has 31 days, so from 1 March to 31 March: 31 days
   - April, May, June, July, August, and September each have 30 or 31 days, so from 1 April to 28 September: 157 days

3. Convert the total number of days into months:
   - 4 days in February
   - 31 days in March
   - 157 days from April to September
   - Total: 4 + 31 + 157 = 192 days

4. Convert days to months:
   - 192 days / 30.44 days per month (average length of a month) ≈ 6.3 months

Therefore, Mexican independence occurred approximately 6.3 months after the Plan of Iguala.

Final Answer: Mexican independence occurred approximately 6.3 months after the Plan of Iguala."

","To determine how many months after the Plan of Iguala Mexican independence occurred, we need to follow these steps:

1. Identify the date of the Plan of Iguala.
2. Identify the date of Mexican independence.
3. Calculate the difference between these two dates.

Step 1: The Plan of Iguala was enacted on 24 February 1821.

Step 2: Mexican independence was achieved on 28 September 1821.

Step 3: To calculate the difference:
- From February 24 to February 28 is 4 days in February.
- The entire month of March (31 days).
- The entire month of April (30 days).
- The entire month of May (31 days).
- The entire month of June (30 days).
- The entire month of July (31 days).
- The entire month of August (31 days).
- The entire month of September up to the 28th (28 - 28 = 0 days).

Adding these together:
4 (February) + 31 (March) + 30 (April) + 31 (May) + 30 (June) + 31 (July) + 31 (August) + 0 (September) = 197 days

Since we need the answer in months, we can approximate:
197 days ≈ 6 months (since 180 days is exactly 6 months and 197 is close to this)

Therefore, Mexican independence occurred approximately 6 months after the Plan of Iguala.

['Forty ninth parallel (1941).jpg | Original Belgian film poster']

","To determine how many months after the UK nationwide release the US nationwide release was, we need to identify the release dates for both the UK and the US.

From the table:
- The UK nationwide release date is 24 November 1941.
- The US nationwide release date is 15 April 1942.

Now, let's calculate the time difference between these two dates:

1. From November 24, 1941, to December 31, 1941:
   - November has 30 days, so from November 24 to November 30 = 7 days
   - December has 31 days
   Total = 7 + 31 = 38 days

2. From January 1, 1942, to March 15, 1942:
   - January has 31 days
   - February has 28 days in 1942 (not a leap year)
   - March 1 through March 15 = 15 days
   Total = 31 + 28 + 15 = 74 days

Adding these together:
38 days (November 24 to December 31) + 74 days (January 1 to March 15) = 112 days

Since we need the answer in months, we convert 112 days to months:
- 112 days / 30.44 days per month (approximate average length of a month) ≈ 3.68 months

Therefore, the US nationwide release was approximately 3.68 months after the UK nationwide release.

Final Answer: The US nationwide release was approximately 3.68 months after the UK nationwide release."

","To determine how many months after the beginning of Bayinnaung's reign as King of Burma his coronation in Toungoo took place, we need to follow these steps:

1. Identify when Bayinnaung became King of Burma.
2. Identify when he was crowned in Toungoo.
3. Calculate the time difference between these two dates.

Step 1: From the table, Bayinnaung became King of Burma and dominions on 30 April 1552.

Step 2: The table also shows that he was crowned at Toungoo on 11 January 1551.

Step 3: To calculate the difference:
   - From 1551 to 1552 is one full year, which is 12 months.
   - We need to count the remaining months from 11 January 1551 to 30 April 1552.

Let's break it down further:
- From 11 January 1551 to 31 January 1551: 20 days
- February 1551: 28 days
- March 1551: 31 days
- April 1551: 30 days (up to 30 April 1552)

Adding these up:
20 + 28 + 31 + 30 = 109 days

Since we are looking for the number of months, we need to convert 109 days into months. However, since the question asks for the number of months directly, we can see that the crowning happened just before the start of the next year, so it's essentially 11 months before the start of his reign in 1552.

Therefore, Bayinnaung's coronation in Toungoo was 11 months before the beginning of his reign as King of Burma.

","To determine how many months after the first crewed flight the last flight occurred, we need to follow these steps:

1. Identify the dates of the first crewed flight and the last flight.
   - First crewed flight: April 12, 1981
   - Last flight: July 21, 2011

2. Calculate the difference in years between these two dates:
   - From 1981 to 2011 is 30 years

3. Convert the years into months:
   - 30 years * 12 months/year = 360 months

4. Account for the partial year between the two dates:
   - The last flight occurred in July 2011, which is 7 months into the year
   - The first crewed flight occurred in April 1981, which is 4 months into the year
   - The difference in months within the partial year is 7 - 4 = 3 months

5. Add the full years converted to months with the partial year difference:
   - 360 months + 3 months = 363 months

Therefore, the last flight occurred 363 months after the first crewed flight.

","To determine how many months after the first flight the X-15 was introduced, we need to calculate the time difference between these two dates.

1. First flight: 8 June 1959
2. Introduction: 17 September 1959

Step 1: Calculate the number of days between the first flight and introduction.
- From 8 June to 30 June: 22 days
- July: 31 days
- August: 31 days
- From 1 September to 17 September: 17 days

Total days = 22 + 31 + 31 + 17 = 101 days

Step 2: Convert days into months.
Since there are approximately 30.44 days in a month (365 days / 12 months), we can convert 101 days into months:
101 days ÷ 30.44 days/month ≈ 3.32 months

Therefore, the X-15 was introduced approximately 3.32 months after its first flight.

Final Answer: The X-15 was introduced approximately 3.32 months after its first flight."

","To determine how many months after the first foreshock the last aftershock occurred, we need to follow these steps:

1. Identify the date of the first foreshock.
2. Identify the date of the last aftershock.
3. Calculate the difference in time between these two dates.

Step 1: The first foreshock occurred on 23 February 1960.

Step 2: The last aftershock occurred on 17 April 1960.

Step 3: To calculate the difference:
- From 23 February to 28 February is 5 days.
- March has 31 days, so from 1 March to 31 March is 31 days.
- From 1 April to 17 April is 17 days.

Adding these up: 5 + 31 + 17 = 53 days.

Since we need the answer in months, we convert 53 days into months. There are approximately 30.44 days in a month, so:
53 days ÷ 30.44 ≈ 1.74 months.

Therefore, the last aftershock occurred approximately 1.74 months after the first foreshock.

","To answer this question, we need to follow these steps:

1. Identify when the 2021 Myanmar protests started.
2. Determine the total number of deaths reported.
3. Calculate the time difference between the start and the point where the death toll reached 2,091.

Step 1: The protests started on 2 February 2021.

Step 2: According to the table, the total number of deaths was 2,037 protesters (as of the latest data provided).

However, the question asks about 2,091 deaths. Since the exact date for 2,091 deaths is not provided in the table, we can assume that the number increased gradually over time.

Step 3: To calculate the time difference:
- We know the protests started on 2 February 2021.
- We need to find how long it took for the death toll to reach 2,091.

Since we don't have exact dates for each death count, we can approximate based on the information given. The table shows a significant increase in deaths over time, but without more precise data, we can't pinpoint the exact month.

Given that the total deaths were 2,037 as of the latest data, and we're asked about 2,091, we can estimate that this likely occurred within a short period after the latest data point.

The most recent data provided is as of 23 May 2021, which is about 3 months after the start of the protests. Given the gradual increase in deaths, it's reasonable to assume that reaching 2,091 deaths would have occurred shortly after this date.

Therefore, the death toll likely reached 2,091 about 3 months after the start of the protests.

Death(s)	2,037 protesters (per AAPP) | 47 police officers and 7 soldiers | (per SAC; as of 23 May 2021)
Detained	11,286 detained currently, (per AAPP)

","To determine how many months after the start of the protests the death toll reached 47 police officers and 7 soldiers, we need to follow these steps:

1. Identify the start date of the protests.
2. Find the entry in the ""Casualties"" section that mentions 47 police officers and 7 soldiers.
3. Calculate the time difference between these two dates.

Step 1: The start date of the protests is given as 2 February 2021.

Step 2: In the ""Casualties"" section, we find this entry:
- Death(s): 2,037 protesters (per AAPP) | 47 police officers and 7 soldiers | (per SAC; as of 23 May 2021)

This indicates that 47 police officers and 7 soldiers died on or before 23 May 2021.

Step 3: Calculate the time difference:
- Start date: 2 February 2021
- End date: 23 May 2021

Counting the months:
- February has 28 days in 2021 (not a leap year), so from 2 February to 28 February is 1 month.
- March is 1 month.
- April is 1 month.
- From 1 May to 23 May is part of May, which counts as 1 more month.

Adding these up: 1 (February) + 1 (March) + 1 (April) + 1 (May) = 4 months.

Therefore, 47 police officers and 7 soldiers died 4 months after the start of the protests.

","To determine how many months people experienced the effects of the 1960 Agadir earthquake, we need to consider the duration of both foreshocks and aftershocks mentioned in the table.

1. **Foreshocks:**
   - The foreshock on 23 February was reported as having a maximum intensity of III (Weak).
   - This foreshock occurred just before the main earthquake on 29 February.

2. **Main Earthquake:**
   - The main earthquake occurred on 29 February 1960 at 23:40:18 WET (UTC±00:00).

3. **Aftershocks:**
   - The first significant aftershock was on 22 March 1960 with a maximum intensity of VI (Strong).
   - Another significant aftershock was on 17 April 1960, also with a maximum intensity of VI (Strong).

Now, let's count the months from the start of the foreshocks to the last significant aftershock:
- February (main earthquake month)
- March (first significant aftershock)
- April (second significant aftershock)

Thus, people experienced the effects of the 1960 Agadir earthquake for 3 months.

","To determine how many months have passed since Horacio Rosatti became President of the Supreme Court of Argentina, we need to compare the current date with the date he took office.

Step 1: Identify the date Horacio Rosatti became President.
According to the table, Horacio Rosatti has been the President since ""1 October 2021"".

Step 2: Determine the current date.
The problem states that the current date is December 2022.

Step 3: Calculate the time difference.
- From October 1, 2021, to December 31, 2021: 
  - October has 31 days, so from October 1 to October 31 is 30 days.
  - November has 30 days.
  - December has 31 days up to December 31.
  Total = 30 + 30 + 31 = 91 days.

- From January 1, 2022, to December 31, 2022:
  This covers all 12 months of 2022.
  Total = 12 * 30.44 (average days per month) ≈ 365.28 days.

- Summing both periods:
  91 days + 365.28 days ≈ 456.28 days.

Step 4: Convert the total days into months.
1 year = 12 months, and approximately 30.44 days per month.
So, 456.28 days ≈ 456.28 / 30.44 ≈ 15.00 months.

Final Answer: It has been approximately 15 months since Horacio Rosatti became President of the Supreme Court of Argentina."

['Black rocket aircraft with stubby wings and short vertical stabilizers above and below tail unit', 'The X-15 pulling away from its drop launch plane']

","To determine how many months separated the introduction of the X-15 from its first flight, we need to follow these steps:

1. Identify the first flight date: 8 June 1959.
2. Identify the introduction date: 17 September 1959.
3. Calculate the difference between these two dates.

Step 1: The first flight was on 8 June 1959.
Step 2: The introduction was on 17 September 1959.
Step 3: To calculate the difference:
   - From 8 June to 30 June: 22 days
   - July: 31 days
   - August: 31 days
   - From 1 September to 17 September: 17 days

Adding these up:
22 + 31 + 31 + 17 = 101 days

Since there are approximately 30.44 days in a month, we can convert 101 days to months:
101 / 30.44 ≈ 3.32 months

Therefore, the X-15's introduction was about 3.32 months after its first flight.

","To determine how many years after Alphonse Gallegos's ordination his consecration took place, we need to find the dates for both events and calculate the difference.

1. Find the ordination date:
   - Ordination: 24 May 1958

2. Find the consecration date:
   - Consecration: 4 November 1981

3. Calculate the difference in years:
   - From 24 May 1958 to 4 November 1981

Let's break it down month by month and year by year:

- From 24 May 1958 to 31 December 1958: 7 months
- Full years from 1959 to 1980: 22 years
- From 1 January 1981 to 4 November 1981: 10 months

Adding these together:
7 months + 22 years + 10 months = 23 years and 17 months

Since the question asks for the number of years, we round down to the nearest whole year.

Therefore, Alphonse Gallegos's consecration took place 23 years after his ordination.

","To answer this question, we need to determine two key pieces of information:
1. When Hasanefendić stopped managing RK Metaloplastika
2. When he began managing his current team (ThSV Eisenach)

Step 1: Identify when Hasanefendić stopped managing RK Metaloplastika
From the ""Teams managed"" section, we can see that he managed RK Metaloplastika from 1979 to 1980.
So, he stopped managing RK Metaloplastika at the end of 1980.

Step 2: Identify when Hasanefendić began managing ThSV Eisenach
From the ""Club information"" section, we see that his current club is ThSV Eisenach (manager).
The last entry for his management history shows he started with ThSV Eisenach in 2018.

Step 3: Calculate the difference in years
The time between the end of 1980 and the start of 2018 is:
2018 - 1980 = 38 years

Therefore, Hasanefendić stopped managing RK Metaloplastika 38 years before he began managing his current team.

","To determine how many years after becoming a Member of the Parliament of Iran Mohammad-Ali Foroughi became Minister of Foreign Affairs, we need to identify the dates for both positions.

1. **Identify the start date of being a Member of the Parliament of Iran:**
   - The table shows that he was a Member of the Parliament of Iran from 19 November 1909 to 3 August 1921.
   - Start date: 19 November 1909

2. **Identify the start date of being Minister of Foreign Affairs:**
   - The table lists his term as Minister of Foreign Affairs from 28 October 1923 to 1 September 1924.
   - Start date: 28 October 1923

3. **Calculate the difference between these two dates:**
   - From 19 November 1909 to 28 October 1923:
     - First, calculate the full years between these dates:
       - From 1909 to 1923: 14 full years
     - Then, calculate the remaining days:
       - From 19 November 1909 to 31 December 1909: 13 days
       - From 1 January 1923 to 28 October 1923: 28 + 31 + 30 + 31 + 31 + 30 + 31 + 31 + 30 + 28 = 284 days
       - Total remaining days: 13 + 284 = 297 days

4. **Convert the remaining days into years:**
   - 297 days is approximately 0.82 years (since 1 year ≈ 365 days).

5. **Sum up the full years and the fraction of a year:**
   - Total time: 14 years + 0.82 years ≈ 14.82 years

Therefore, Mohammad-Ali Foroughi became Minister of Foreign Affairs approximately 14.82 years after becoming a Member of the Parliament of Iran.

['Silver medal - second place | 2015 Austin | Stadium Super Trucks', 'Bronze medal - third place | 2014 Austin | Stadium Super Trucks', 'Last updated on: April 14, 2022.']

","To answer this question, we need to determine two key pieces of information:
1. When Robby Gordon's debut in Stadium Super Trucks was.
2. When he won the silver medal at the Summer X Games.

Step 1: Determine Gordon's debut in Stadium Super Trucks
From the ""Stadium Super Trucks career"" section, we can see that his debut season was 2013.

Step 2: Determine when Gordon won the silver medal at the Summer X Games
From the ""Summer X Games"" section, we see that he won a silver medal at the 2015 Austin event.

Step 3: Calculate the difference in years
2015 (year of silver medal win) - 2013 (debut year) = 2 years

Therefore, it was 2 years after his debut in Stadium Super Trucks that Gordon won a silver medal at the Summer X Games.

","To determine how many years after its demolition the rebuilding of the Palace of Westminster began, we need to follow these steps:

1. Identify the year of demolition.
2. Identify the start year of the rebuilding process.
3. Calculate the difference between these two years.

Step 1: From the table, we can see that the Palace of Westminster was demolished in 1834 due to a fire.

Step 2: The table also indicates that the rebuilding process began between 1840-1876. For simplicity, we'll use the earliest year of this range, which is 1840.

Step 3: To calculate the number of years between the demolition and the start of rebuilding:
   1840 (start of rebuilding) - 1834 (demolition) = 6 years

Therefore, the rebuilding of the Palace of Westminster began 6 years after its demolition.

Final Answer: 6 years."

","To determine how many years after leaving office as the 8th Minister of National Education Mohammad Yamin took office as the 14th Minister of Information, we need to follow these steps:

1. Identify the dates when Yamin left office as the 8th Minister of National Education and when he took office as the 14th Minister of Information.
2. Calculate the difference between these two dates.

Step 1:
- The 8th Minister of National Education: He served from 30 July 1953 to 12 August 1955. So, he left office on 12 August 1955.
- The 14th Minister of Information: He served from 6 March 1962 to 17 October 1962. So, he took office on 6 March 1962.

Step 2:
- To find the difference, we subtract the earlier date (12 August 1955) from the later date (6 March 1962).

Let's break it down month by month:

- From 12 August 1955 to 31 December 1955: 4 months and 19 days
- 1956: 12 months
- 1957: 12 months
- 1958: 12 months
- 1959: 12 months
- 1960: 12 months
- 1961: 12 months
- From 1 January 1962 to 6 March 1962: 2 months and 6 days

Adding these up:
- 4 + 12 + 12 + 12 + 12 + 12 + 12 + 2 = 78 months

Converting months to years:
- 78 months / 12 months per year = 6.5 years

Therefore, Mohammad Yamin took office as the 14th Minister of Information 6.5 years after leaving office as the 8th Minister of National Education.

Final Answer: 6.5 years."

Casualties and losses

Total | 5,800+ killed

","To answer this question, we need to follow these steps:

1. Identify when terrorism began in Egypt.
2. Determine when Wilayat Sinai became a belligerent.
3. Calculate the number of years between these two events.

Step 1: When did terrorism begin in Egypt?
The table states that ""Terrorism in Egypt (2013-present)"" is part of this conflict, so terrorism began in Egypt in 2013.

Step 2: When did Wilayat Sinai become a belligerent?
Looking at the ""Belligerents"" section, we see that Wilayat Sinai is listed as ""(from 2014)"".

Step 3: Calculate the difference in years.
2014 (when Wilayat Sinai became a belligerent) - 2013 (when terrorism began) = 1 year

Therefore, Wilayat Sinai became a belligerent 1 year after terrorism began in Egypt.

","To determine how many years after the beginning of the war PDR Ethiopia became a belligerent, we need to follow these steps:

1. Identify when the war began:
   - The Ethiopian Civil War started on 12 September 1974.

2. Find when PDR Ethiopia became a belligerent:
   - From the table, we see that PDR Ethiopia became a belligerent in 1987.

3. Calculate the difference between these two dates:
   - Start date: 12 September 1974
   - End date: 1987

4. Subtract the start year from the end year:
   - 1987 - 1974 = 13 years

Therefore, PDR Ethiopia became a belligerent 13 years after the beginning of the war.

","To answer this question, we need to determine two key dates from the information provided:

1. When was the constitution adopted?
2. When was the monarchy abolished?

Let's find these dates:

1. **Constitution adopted**: The table provides this information:
   - ""Constitution adopted: 16 July 1931""

2. **Monarchy abolished**: The table also provides this information:
   - ""Monarchy abolished: 21 March 1975""

Now, we need to calculate the difference between these two dates:

- From 16 July 1931 to 21 March 1975

To do this accurately, we can break it down into years:

- From 16 July 1931 to 31 December 1931: 6 months
- Full years from 1932 to 1974: 42 years
- From 1 January 1975 to 21 March 1975: 2 months and 10 days

Adding these up:
- 6 months + 42 years + 2 months and 10 days = 43 years and 10 days

Since the question asks for the number of years, we round down to the nearest whole year.

Final Answer: 43 years"

","To determine how many years after the death of his first wife Richard Caswell died, we need to follow these steps:

1. Identify when Caswell's first wife died.
2. Identify when Caswell died.
3. Calculate the difference between these two dates.

Step 1: From the personal details section, we can see that Caswell's first wife, Mary Mackilwean, died in 1757.

Step 2: From the same section, we can see that Caswell died on November 10, 1789.

Step 3: To calculate the number of years between these dates:
   - First, let's note that both events happened in different centuries.
   - From 1757 to 1780 (end of the year before he died), that's 23 years.
   - From 1780 to 1789, that's 9 more years.
   - Adding these together gives us 23 + 9 = 32 years.

Therefore, Richard Caswell died 32 years after the death of his first wife.

   - The first medal listed under Olympic Games is from 1984 Los Angeles for the 4×100 m freestyle event.
   
2. Identify the last Olympic medal:
   - The last medal listed under Olympic Games is from 1992 Barcelona for the 4×100 m medley event.
   
3. Calculate the time difference between these two events:
   - First medal: 1984

","To determine how many years ago terrorism began in Egypt, we need to look at the start date provided for the current war in the table.

Step 1: Identify the start date.
The table states that the current war, which includes Terrorism in Egypt (2013-present), began on ""3 July 2013"".

Step 2: Calculate the time elapsed from the start date to the current date.
The current date is given as December 2022.

Step 3: Perform the calculation.
From July 3, 2013, to December 2022:
- From July 3, 2013, to December 31, 2013: 9 months and 28 days
- Full years from 2014 to 2022: 8 years

Adding these together:
8 years + 9 months + 28 days

Since the question asks for the number of years, we can round down to the nearest whole year, as the additional 9 months and 28 days do not constitute a full year.

Therefore, terrorism began approximately 9 years ago.

","To determine how many years ago the Salvadoran Civil War ended, we need to follow these steps:

1. Identify the end date of the Salvadoran Civil War from the table.
2. Determine the current year.
3. Calculate the difference between the current year and the end year of the war.

Step 1: From the table, we can see that the Salvadoran Civil War ended on ""16 January 1992"".

Step 2: The current date provided in the instruction is December 2022.

Step 3: To calculate the difference:
- From January 16, 1992, to December 31, 1992: 11 months and 15 days
- From January 1, 1993, to December 31, 2022: 30 years

Adding these together:
30 years + 11 months + 15 days = 30 years (since the exact date within the year does not affect the year count)

Therefore, the Salvadoran Civil War ended 30 years ago.

Final Answer: 30 years ago."

Step 1: Identifying the end date
From the table, we can see that the Western Sahara War ended on 6 September 1991.

Step 2: Calculating the difference
Current date: December 2022
End date of the war: 6 September 1991

Let's break it down:
- From 6 September 1991 to 31 December 1991: 3 months and 26 days
- From 1 January 1992 to 31 December 2022: 31 years

Adding these together:

","To determine how many years ago AT&T Inc. was founded, we need to follow these steps:

1. Find the founding date of AT&T Inc.
2. Compare the founding date to the current date (December 2022).

Step 1: From the table, we can see that AT&T Inc. was founded on October 5, 1983.

Step 2: The current date is December 2022. To calculate the number of years, we need to:
- Calculate the difference in years between 2022 and 1983
- Check if any full years have passed since October 5, 1983, into 2022

Calculation:

","To determine how many years ago Brazil declared itself a republic, we need to find the relevant information from the table provided.

1. First, we look for the ""Republic"" entry in the table.
2. We find it in the ""Independence"" row, which states that Brazil became a republic on ""15 November 1889"".
3. We know the current year is 2022 (as implied by the context of the question).
4. To calculate the number of years since 1889, we subtract 1889 from 2022:
   2022 - 1889 = 133

","To determine how many years are between Australia's first ODI and their last T20I, we need to follow these steps:

1. Identify the date of Australia's first ODI:
   - From the table, the first ODI was against England at the Melbourne Cricket Ground on 5 January 1971.

2. Identify the date of Australia's last T20I:
   - From the table, the last T20I was against Sri Lanka at Pallekele International Cricket Stadium on 11 June 2022.

3. Calculate the difference in years between these two dates:
   - First ODI: 5 January 1971
   - Last T20I: 11 June 2022

To calculate the difference accurately, we can use the following approach:
- From 1971 to 2021 is 50 years.
- From 1 January 2021 to 11 June 2022 is approximately 5.5 years.

Adding these together: 50 + 5.5 = 55.5 years.

","To solve this problem, we need to identify the years when Malaysia's nominal GDP rank was 34th and when its PPP GDP per capita was $32,901. Then, we will calculate the difference between these two years.

Step 1: Identify the year for the nominal GDP rank 34th.
From the table, we can see that Malaysia's nominal GDP rank was 34th in 2022.

Step 2: Identify the year for the PPP GDP per capita $32,901.
From the table, we can see that Malaysia's PPP GDP per capita was $32,901 in 2022.

Step 3: Calculate the difference between these two years.
Since both values are for the year 2022, the difference is 0 years.

Therefore, the number of years between the year Malaysia's nominal GDP rank was 34th and the year its PPP GDP per capita was $32,901 is 0 years.

","To answer this question, we need to identify the year of the 2021 Myanmar protests and the year of the 2020 general election.

1. From the table, we see that the ""2021 Myanmar protests"" started on ""2 February 2021 - present"". This means the protests began in 2021.

2. The goals of the protesters include ""Recognition of the 2020 general election results"".

3. Since the protests started in 2021 and the goal is to recognize the 2020 election results, we can deduce that the 2020 general election took place in 2020.

4. To find out how many years before the 2021 protests the 2020 election occurred, we subtract 2020 from 2021:

","To determine how many years Ambrose Rayappan served as Archbishop Emeritus of Pondicherry and Cuddalore, we need to identify when he became Archbishop Emeritus and when his term ended.

Step 1: Identify the start of his term as Archbishop Emeritus.
The table does not explicitly mention when Ambrose Rayappan became Archbishop Emeritus. However, it lists him as ""Archbishop Emeritus of Pondicherry and Cuddalore"" under the category ""Christian leader."" This suggests that his term as Archbishop Emeritus began after he stepped down from being the active Archbishop.

Step 2: Identify when he stepped down as the active Archbishop.
From the table, we can see that his term as Archbishop ended on 17 March 1973.

Step 3: Determine when he died.
Ambrose Rayappan died on 24 November 1999.

Step 4: Calculate the duration of his term as Archbishop Emeritus.
Since he became Archbishop Emeritus after stepping down in 1973 and died in 1999, we need to calculate the difference between these two dates:
- From 17 March 1973 to 24 November 1999

Calculating this period:
- From 17 March 1973 to 31 December 1973 = 9 months and 14 days
- Full years from 1974 to 1998 = 25 years
- From 1 January 1999 to 24 November 1999 = 10 months and 24 days

Adding these together:
9 months + 25 years + 10 months = 26 years and 1 month
26 years and 1 month is approximately 26 years.

Therefore, Ambrose Rayappan served as Archbishop Emeritus for about 26 years.

Final Answer: Ambrose Rayappan served as Archbishop Emeritus of Pondicherry and Cuddalore for approximately 26 years."

","To determine how many years Argentina supported the Salvadoran Civil War, we need to follow these steps:

1. Identify when Argentina began supporting the conflict.
2. Identify when Argentina stopped supporting the conflict.
3. Calculate the duration of support.

From the information provided:
1. Argentina supported the conflict ""until 1983"".
2. The civil war started on ""15 October 1979"" and ended on ""16 January 1992"".

Since Argentina's support ended in 1983, we need to calculate the period from the start of the war (1979) to when Argentina withdrew its support (1983).

1983 - 1979 = 4 years

Therefore, Argentina supported the Salvadoran Civil War for 4 years.

Final Answer: Argentina supported the Salvadoran Civil War for 4 years."

","To determine how many years Babe Young played in MLB, we need to look at his first and last appearances in the league.

1. MLB debut: September 26, 1936, for the New York Giants.
2. Last MLB appearance: October 2, 1948, for the St. Louis Cardinals.

Now, let's calculate the number of years between these two dates:

1. Start from September 26, 1936.
2. End on October 2, 1948.

We can count the full years directly:
- 1936 to 1948 is 12 years, but since he started in the middle of 1936 and ended in the middle of 1948, we need to verify if it's exactly 12 years or more.

Let's break it down:
- From September 26, 1936, to September 26, 1948, is exactly 12 years.
- Adding the partial months from September 26, 1948, to October 2, 1948, is less than a full year.

Therefore, Babe Young played for MLB for 12 years.

","To determine how many years Theo Bot served as Ambassador of the Netherlands to Austria, we need to look at the information provided in the table.

1. First, we find the relevant entry in the table:
   ""Ambassador of the | Netherlands to Austria""

2. Next, we check the dates given:
   ""In office | 17 January 1968 - 1 July 1973""

3. To calculate the duration, we subtract the start date from the end date:
   - Start date: 17 January 1968
   - End date: 1 July 1973

4. We can break this down into months and years:
   - From 17 January 1968 to 31 December 1972: 4 years and 11 months
   - From 1 January 1973 to 1 July 1973: 6 months

5. Adding these together:
   4 years + 11 months + 6 months = 4 years + 17 months

6. Since 17 months is more than a year, we can convert it to:
   4 years + 1 year and 5 months = 5 years and 5 months

Therefore, Theo Bot served as Ambassador of the Netherlands to Austria for approximately 5 years and 5 months.

Final Answer: Theo Bot served as Ambassador of the Netherlands to Austria for about 5 years and 5 months."

","To determine how many years it took for inflation in France to decrease by 0.8%, we need to compare the given inflation rates over time. The table provides inflation data for three years:

1. 2018: 2.1%
2. 2019: 1.3%
3. 2020: 0.5%

We need to find the difference between the highest and lowest values among these years:

- The highest value is 2.1% (2018).
- The lowest value is 0.5% (2020).

The difference between these two values is:
2.1% - 0.5% = 1.6%

This means that the inflation rate decreased by 1.6% over the period from 2018 to 2020. However, this is not exactly a 0.8% decrease, but rather a larger decrease.

Since the question asks for a decrease of 0.8%, we can see that the inflation rate decreased from 2.1% in 2018 to 1.3% in 2019, which is a decrease of 0.8% over one year.

Therefore, it took 1 year for inflation in France to decrease by 0.8%.

Final Answer: 1 year."

","To determine how many years it took for the Human Development Index (HDI) of France to grow by 0.089 points, we need to follow these steps:

1. Identify the HDI values given in the table.
2. Calculate the difference between these values.
3. Determine the time period over which this change occurred.
4. Calculate the number of years based on the time period.

Step 1: Identifying HDI values
- The table provides two HDI values:
  - 2020: 0.909 (very high, ranked 26th)
  - 2019: 0.820 (very high, ranked 26th)

Step 2: Calculating the difference
- Difference = 2020 value - 2019 value
- Difference = 0.909 - 0.820 = 0.089

Step 3: Determining the time period
- The values provided are for 2019 and 2020, so the time period is 1 year.

Step 4: Calculating the number of years
- Since the HDI increased by 0.089 points over 1 year, it took 1 year for this increase.

Therefore, it took 1 year for the Human Development Index of France to grow by 0.089 points.

Final Answer: 1 year."

['15 Blackburn Skua, Bristol Perseus (15650612347).jpg', 'Blackburn Skua in flight']

","To determine how many years the B-24 Skua flew before it was completely retired, we need to identify its active service period and subtract the year it was withdrawn from front-line duties from that period.

Step 1: Identify the introduction and retirement dates.
- Introduction: November 1938
- Retired: 1941 (front-line duties) and March 1945 (other duties)

Step 2: Calculate the active service period.
- From November 1938 to December 1940 (front-line duties): 2 years and 1 month
- From January 1941 to March 1945 (other duties): 4 years and 2 months

Step 3: Sum up the active service periods.
- Total active service: 2 years 1 month + 4 years 2 months = 6 years 3 months

Step 4: Determine the period before complete retirement.
- The B-24 Skua was withdrawn from front-line duties in 1941, so we consider the period until March 1941 for full front-line service.

Step 5: Calculate the number of years before complete retirement.
- From November 1938 to March 1941: 2 years 4 months

Therefore, the B-24 Skua flew for approximately 2 years and 4 months before it was completely retired.

Religion	Serbian Orthodox

","To determine how many years elapsed between the reigns of Prince of Serbia for Miloš Obrenović I, we need to look at the dates provided in the table.

1. The table shows that Miloš Obrenović I's reign as Prince of Serbia started on 6 November 1817.
2. The table also shows that his reign ended on 25 June 1839.
3. To calculate the duration, we need to find the difference between these two dates:
   - From 6 November 1817 to 25 June 1839

Let's break this down:
- From 6 November 1817 to 5 November 1817 = 0 years
- From 6 November 1817 to 31 December 1817 = 2 months and 26 days
- From 1 January 1818 to 31 December 1838 = 20 full years
- From 1 January 1839 to 25 June 1839 = 5 months and 25 days

Adding these together:
- 20 years + 2 months + 26 days + 5 months + 25 days
- 20 years + 7 months + 51 days

Since we typically round years when dealing with partial years in such calculations, we can approximate this to 20 years.

Therefore, the number of years that elapsed between the reigns of Prince of Serbia for Miloš Obrenović I is approximately 20 years.

Step 2: Identifying the year of his election to the Motorsports Hall of Fame
- From the Awards section, we see that he was inducted into the Motorsports Hall of Fame of America in 2019.

Step 3: Calculating the difference
- The difference between 2019 (year of induction) and 2013 (year of retirement) is 2019 - 2013 = 6 years.

Therefore, Dario Franchitti had been retired from IndyCar for 6 years when he was elected to the Motorsports Hall of Fame.

","To determine how many years Dick King-Smith had been a children's author when he married his second wife, we need to follow these steps:

1. Identify the period during which Dick King-Smith was a children's author.
2. Determine the year he married his second wife.
3. Calculate the difference between these two dates.

Step 1: From the table, we can see that Dick King-Smith's period as a writer (and specifically as a children's novelist) was from 1978 to 2007.

Step 2: The table also provides information about his marriages. His second marriage was to Zona Bedding, which started in 2001 and ended in 2011 due to his death. However, we need the year he got married, which would be 2001.

Step 3: Now, we calculate the difference:
- He started writing for children in 1978.
- He married his second wife in 2001.

So, the number of years he had been a children's author before marrying his second wife is:
2001 - 1978 = 23 years.

Final Answer: Dick King-Smith had been a children's author for 23 years when he married his second wife."

","To determine how many years longer Wilson played for the New York Giants compared to the Boston Braves, we need to calculate the duration of his time with each team.

Step 1: Calculate the duration with the New York Giants.
- Wilson's MLB debut was on September 29, 1908.
- His last appearance with the New York Giants was at the end of the 1913 season.
- Duration = 1913 - 1908 + 1 = 6 years (including the full 1908 season).

Step 2: Calculate the duration with the Boston Braves.
- Wilson joined the Boston Braves in 1918.
- His last appearance with the Boston Braves was at the end of the 1920 season.
- Duration = 1920 - 1918 + 1 = 3 years (including the full 1918 season).

Step 3: Compare the durations.
- Years with New York Giants: 6 years
- Years with Boston Braves: 3 years
- Difference: 6 - 3 = 3 years

Final Answer: Wilson played 3 years longer for the New York Giants than for the Boston Braves."

","To determine how many years longer the orbiter's planned mission duration is compared to its current elapsed duration, we need to follow these steps:

1. Identify the planned mission duration for the orbiter.
2. Identify the current elapsed duration for the orbiter.
3. Calculate the difference between the planned and elapsed durations.

Step 1: Planned mission duration for the orbiter
From the table, we can see that the orbiter's planned mission duration is ""~ 7.5 years"".

Step 2: Current elapsed duration for the orbiter
The table states that the orbiter's elapsed mission duration is ""2 years, 10 months (elapsed)"".

Step 3: Calculate the difference
To find the difference, we need to convert both durations into the same unit (years). 

Planned duration: 7.5 years
Elapsed duration: 2 years + 10/12 years = 2 + 0.8333... ≈ 2.8333 years

Now, subtract the elapsed duration from the planned duration:
7.5 - 2.8333 ≈ 4.6667 years

Rounding to one decimal place, the difference is approximately 4.7 years.

Final Answer: The orbiter's planned mission duration is approximately 4.7 years longer than its current elapsed duration."

","To determine how many years longer Habte Giyorgis was prime minister than Yekuno Amlak was emperor, we need to follow these steps:

1. Identify the duration Yekuno Amlak was emperor.
2. Identify the duration Habte Giyorgis was prime minister.
3. Calculate the difference between these two durations.

Step 1: Yekuno Amlak was the first emperor of the Ethiopian Empire and ruled from 1270 to 1285. This means he was emperor for:
1285 - 1270 = 15 years

Step 2: Habte Giyorgis was the first prime minister of the Ethiopian Empire and served from 1909 to 1927. This means he was prime minister for:
1927 - 1909 = 18 years

Step 3: To find out how many years longer Habte Giyorgis was prime minister than Yekuno Amlak was emperor, we subtract the duration of Yekuno Amlak's rule from the duration of Habte Giyorgis's rule:
18 years (Habte Giyorgis) - 15 years (Yekuno Amlak) = 3 years

Therefore, Habte Giyorgis was prime minister 3 years longer than Yekuno Amlak was emperor.

","To determine how many years longer Mohammad-Ali Foroughi's second term as 22nd Prime Minister of Iran was compared to his first term, we need to calculate the duration of each term and then find the difference.

### Step 1: Calculate the duration of the first term
- Start date: 27 August 1941
- End date: 9 March 1942

First, convert these dates to a common format for easier calculation:
- 27 August 1941 = 27/08/1941
- 9 March 1942 = 09/03/1942

The first term spans from August to March, which means it covers the entire months of August and September of 1941, and all of 1942 up until March. This is equivalent to about 7 months.

### Step 2: Calculate the duration of the second term
- Start date: 18 September 1933
- End date: 3 December 1935

Convert these dates to a common format:
- 18 September 1933 = 18/09/1933
- 3 December 1935 = 03/12/1935

The second term spans from September 1933 to December 1935, which is approximately 2 years and 3 months.

### Step 3: Convert the durations to years for comparison
- First term: Approximately 7 months = 7/12 ≈ 0.583 years
- Second term: Approximately 2 years and 3 months = 2 + 3/12 = 2.25 years

### Step 4: Calculate the difference in duration
- Difference = Duration of second term - Duration of first term
- Difference = 2.25 years - 0.583 years ≈ 1.667 years

### Step 5: Round to a reasonable precision
- The difference is approximately 1.67 years.

### Final Answer:
Mohammad-Ali Foroughi's second term as 22nd Prime Minister of Iran was approximately 1.67 years longer than his first term."

","To determine how many years longer Peter III's reign as King of Aragon and Valencia was compared to his reign as King of Sicily, we need to follow these steps:

1. Identify the start and end dates for both reigns.
2. Calculate the duration of each reign.
3. Subtract the duration of the Sicily reign from the Aragon and Valencia reign.

Step 1: Identify the start and end dates
- Reign as King of Aragon and Valencia:
  Start: 27 July 1276
  End: November 1285
- Reign as King of Sicily (jure uxoris):
  Start: 4 September 1282
  End: November 1285

Step 2: Calculate the duration of each reign
- Reign as King of Aragon and Valencia:
  From 27 July 1276 to 31 December 1285 = 9 years and 5 months
- Reign as King of Sicily (jure uxoris):
  From 4 September 1282 to 31 December 1285 = 3 years and 4 months

Step 3: Subtract the duration of the Sicily reign from the Aragon and Valencia reign
- 9 years and 5 months - 3 years and 4 months = 6 years and 1 month

Therefore, Peter III's reign as King of Aragon and Valencia was 6 years and 1 month longer than his reign as King of Sicily.

","To determine how many years longer Zidane's senior career was compared to his youth career, we need to calculate the duration of each period.

Step 1: Calculate the duration of Zidane's youth career.
- Start year: 1981
- End year: 1989
Duration = 1989 - 1981 = 8 years

Step 2: Calculate the duration of Zidane's senior career.
- The senior career spans from 1989 to 2006.
Duration = 2006 - 1989 = 17 years

Step 3: Find the difference between the two durations.
Difference = Duration of senior career - Duration of youth career
Difference = 17 years - 8 years = 9 years

Therefore, Zidane's senior career was 9 years longer than his youth career.

","To solve this problem, we need to determine the duration of two periods and then find the difference between them.

Step 1: Calculate the duration of the period between the Hammadid and Zayyanid dynasties.
- Hammadid dynasty ended in 1015
- Zayyanid dynasty began in 1236
- Duration = 1236 - 1015 = 221 years

Step 2: Calculate the duration of the period between the Rustamid and Zirid dynasties.
- Rustamid dynasty ended in 776
- Zirid dynasty began in 972
- Duration = 972 - 776 = 196 years

Step 3: Find the difference between the two durations.
- Difference = 221 years - 196 years = 25 years

Therefore, the period between the Hammadid and Zayyanid dynasties was 25 years longer than the period between the Rustamid and Zirid dynasties.

","To determine how many years passed between the first flight and the introduction of the JF-17 Thunder, we need to follow these steps:

1. Identify the first flight date: August 25, 2003
2. Identify the introduction date: March 12, 2007
3. Calculate the difference between these two dates

Let's break it down further:
- The first flight was on August 25, 2003.
- The introduction was on March 12, 2007.

To calculate the time difference:
- From August 25, 2003, to August 25, 2007: 4 years
- From August 25, 2007, to March 12, 2007: We need to subtract this period from the full year.

Since we're already in the same year (2007), we just need to account for the months:
- From August 25 to December 31, 2007: 4 months

So, the total time is 4 years minus 4 months. However, since the exact month difference isn't specified, we can consider it as 4 years for simplicity.

Therefore, the number of years that passed between the first flight and the introduction of the JF-17 Thunder is 4 years.

","To determine how many years passed between the order and laying down of INS Trishul, we need to identify the relevant dates from the information provided:

1. The ship was ordered on 17 November 1997.
2. The ship was laid down on 24 September 1999.

Now, let's calculate the difference:

1. From 17 November 1997 to 31 December 1997:

","To determine how many years prior to Cumberbatch turning 45 the picture was taken, we need to follow these steps:

1. Identify when Cumberbatch turned 45.
2. Find out when the picture was taken.
3. Calculate the difference between these two dates.

Step 1: Cumberbatch turned 45 on his birthday, which is 19 July 2021.

Step 2: The image provided in the 'Awards' section is labeled ""BCumberbatch Comic-Con 2019.jpg"". This suggests the photo was taken at the 2019 San Diego Comic-Con.

Step 3: We need to find the exact date of the 2019 San Diego Comic-Con. The Comic-Con typically takes place in late July or early August each year. For simplicity, let's assume it took place around mid-July 2019.

Now, we calculate the difference:
- 19 July 2021 (Cumberbatch's 45th birthday)
- 14 July 2019 (mid-July 2019 for Comic-Con)

2021 - 2019 = 2 years

Therefore, the picture was taken 2 years prior to Cumberbatch turning 45.

","To determine how many years Aslam Watanjar served as Minister of Defense, we need to look at the information provided in the table.

Step 1: Identify the relevant period for Minister of Defense.
The table shows two entries for Aslam Watanjar as Minister of Defense:
- In office: 6 March 1990 - April 1992
- In office: April - 28 July 1979

Step 2: Calculate the duration for each period.
For the first period:
- From 6 March 1990 to April 1992:
  1990 - 6 March to 31 December = 9 months in 1990
  1991 - full year = 12 months
  1992 - January and February = 2 months

","To determine how many years The Rolling Stones were on tour between 2012 and 2016, we need to look at the tour chronology provided in the table and count the tours that fall within this period.

1. **Identify relevant tours**: The table lists three tours: ""50 & Counting"" (2012-13), ""14 On Fire"" (2014), and ""Zip Code"" (2015).

2. **Count tours from 2012 to 2016**:

   - ""14 On Fire"" (2014): This tour took place entirely in 2014.
   - ""Zip Code"" (2015): This tour occurred in 2015.

3. **Sum the years**: Adding up the years for these tours, we get 2 (from ""50 & Counting"") + 1 (from ""14 On Fire"") + 1 (from ""Zip Code"") = 4 years.

Now, let's calculate the number of years between these two dates:

- Introduction: November 1938
- Withdrawal from front-line duties: 1941

From November 1938 to 1941, we can break it down as follows:
- From November 1938 to December 1938: 1 month
- Full year 1939: 1 year
- Full year 1940: 1 year
- From January 1941 to December 1941: 1 year

Adding these up:
1 (month) + 1 (year) + 1 (year) + 1 (year) = 3.125 years

Since the exact month is not specified for the withdrawal, we consider only full years, which gives us 3 years.

Therefore, the B-24 Skuas were on the front line for 3 years.

","To determine how many years were between independence from Russia and independence from the USSR, we need to identify the relevant dates from the information provided in the table.

1. **Independence from Russia**: The table states that Belarus declared its independence from Russia on March 25, 1918.
2. **Independence from the USSR**: The table indicates that Belarus gained independence from the USSR on August 25, 1991.

Now, let's calculate the difference between these two dates:

- From March 25, 1918, to August 25, 1991:
  - From March 25, 1918, to December 31, 1918: 9 months and 8 days (approximately 9.27 months)
  - From January 1, 1919, to December 31, 1990: 72 years
  - From January 1, 1991, to August 25, 1991: 8 months and 25 days (approximately 8.21 months)

Adding these together:
- 9.27 months + 72 years + 8.21 months = 72 years + (9.27 + 8.21) months ≈ 72 years + 17.48 months

Since 17.48 months is close to 17.5 months, which is approximately 1.46 years, we can round this to 1.5 years for simplicity.

Therefore, the total number of years between independence from Russia and independence from the USSR is approximately 72 + 1.5 = 73.5 years.

","To determine the number of years between the end of the last monarch's reign and the establishment of Denmark-Norway, we need to identify these two key dates from the information provided:

1. **End of the last monarch's reign:**
   - The last monarch mentioned is Christian II, who reigned from 1513-1523.
   - His last year of reign would be 1523.

2. **Establishment of Denmark-Norway:**
   - According to the table, Denmark-Norway was established in 1537.

Now, we calculate the difference between these two years:

   - The table shows ""Appointed 29 April 1912""

2. Identify his birth date:
   - The table states ""Born 10 November 1859""

3. Calculate the age at the time of appointment:
   - We need to calculate the difference between 29 April 1912 and 10 November 1859

Let's break down the calculation:
- From 10 November 1859 to 10 November 1912: 53 years
- From 10 November 1912 to 29 April 1912: 3 months and 19 days

Since he was already 53 years old on his birthday (10 November), and it was only 3 months and 19 days until his appointment, we can conclude that he was 53 years old when he became the Bishop.

Final Answer: Alojzije Mišić was 53 years old when he became the Bishop of Mostar-Duvno and Apostolic Administrator of Trebinje-Mrkan."

","To determine how old Alojzije Mišić was when he was consecrated, we need to follow these steps:

1. Identify the date of his consecration:
   - The table shows that Alojzije Mišić was consecrated on 18 June 1912.

- Adding the days from 11 November 1911 to 18 June 1912:
  - 11 November to 31 December = 21 days
  - 1 January to 18 June = 181 days
  - Total additional days = 21 + 181 = 202 days

Since 202 days is more than half a year, we can consider him to be 53 years old at the time of his consecration.

","To determine Alphonse Gallegos' age when he became Auxiliary Bishop of Sacramento, we need to follow these steps:

1. Identify the year he became Auxiliary Bishop of Sacramento.
2. Determine his birth year from the personal details provided.
3. Calculate his age at the time of appointment.

Step 1: From the table, we see that Alphonse Gallegos was appointed as Titular Bishop of Sasabe in 1981 and held this position until 1991. However, the specific year he became Auxiliary Bishop of Sacramento is not explicitly mentioned in the given information.

Step 2: His birth year is clearly stated as 1931.

Step 3: Since we cannot pinpoint the exact year he became Auxiliary Bishop of Sacramento, we can only provide an estimate based on the information available. Given that he was appointed Bishop in 1981 and died in 1991, it is reasonable to assume he likely became Auxiliary Bishop before 1981.

If we assume he became Auxiliary Bishop in 1980 (a common practice for such appointments), we can calculate:
1980 - 1931 = 49 years old.

Therefore, if he became Auxiliary Bishop in 1980, he would have been 49 years old.

Final Answer: Based on the available information and assuming he became Auxiliary Bishop in 1980, Alphonse Gallegos would have been approximately 49 years old when he became Auxiliary Bishop of Sacramento."

   - In 2014, she would be 2014 - 1982 = 32 years old

3. Verify if there were any leap years within this period that might affect the calculation:
   - The relevant leap years between 1982 and 2014 are 1984, 1988, 1992, 1996, 2000, 2004, 2008, and 2012
   - However, since the partnership ended in 2014, we only need to consider the leap years up to 2014
   - The age calculation remains 32 years old

Therefore, Nicki Minaj was 32 years old when she ended her partnership with Safaree Samuels.

Final Answer: Nicki Minaj was 32 years old when she ended her partnership with Safaree Samuels."

","To determine how old Michael Owen was when he began his senior career, we need to follow these steps:

1. Identify when Owen's senior career started.
2. Calculate his age at that time.

Step 1: Identifying the start of Owen's senior career
The ""Senior career"" section shows his first year in a senior team:

This indicates that Owen started his senior career in 1996.

Step 2: Calculating his age in 1996
We know from the ""Personal information"" section that Owen was born on 14 December 1979.

To find out how old he was in 1996:
- 1996 - 1979 = 17 years
- Since his birthday in 1979 had not yet occurred in 1996, he would be 16 years old at the start of 1996, and turn 17 in December 1996.

2. Find out when Federer was born:
   - According to the ""Born"" row, Federer was born on 8 August 1981.

3. Calculate the age:

","To determine how old Sam Snead was when he turned professional, we need to follow these steps:

1. Identify the year Sam Snead turned professional.
2. Find his birth year.
3. Calculate the age difference between the two years.

Step 1: From the ""Career"" section, we see that Sam Snead ""Turned professional 1934.""

Step 1: From the ""Olympic Games"" section, we can see that Thiago Alves won a Silver medal for the Team at the 2012 London Olympic Games.

Step 2: To calculate his age in 2012:
   - Thiago Alves was born on July 26, 1986.
   - The 2012 London Olympics took place in 2012.
   - We need to calculate his age as of July 26, 2012.

Since his birthday (July 26) is before the Olympics (which would be in late summer or early fall), he would have already turned 36 years old by the time of the Olympics.

Therefore, Thiago Alves was 36 years old when he won his first Olympic medal in 2012.

Final Answer: Thiago Alves was 36 years old when he won his first Olympic medal in 2012."

1. Identify when the Mahathir Science Award was given.
2. Determine Zumla's age on that date.

Step 1: Identifying the date of the award
From the ""Awards"" section, we can see that Zumla won the Mahathir Science Award in 2020.

Step 2: Determining Zumla's age in 2020
Zumla was born on 15 May 1955. To find his age in 2020:
- We subtract his birth year from 2020: 2020 - 1955 = 65 years old
- Since his birthday (15 May) had already passed by 2020, we don't need to adjust for the month.

Therefore, Zumla was 65 years old when he won the Mahathir Science Award in 2020.

Final Answer: Zumla was 65 years old when he won the Mahathir Science Award."

","To determine how old the church was when it was consecrated, we need to follow these steps:

1. Identify the year the church was founded.
2. Identify the year the church was consecrated.
3. Calculate the difference between these two years.

From the information provided:
- The church was founded in the 13th century. However, the exact founding year is not specified.
- The church was consecrated on 31 July 1949.

Since we don't have the exact founding year, we can only calculate the age relative to the 13th century. We know that the 13th century spans from 1201 to 1300.

Let's assume the earliest possible founding year, which would be 1201:
- From 1201 to 1949 is 748 years.

If we assume the latest possible founding year, which would be 1300:
- From 1300 to 1949 is 649 years.

Therefore, the church was approximately 649 to 748 years old when it was consecrated in 1949.

Final Answer: The church was approximately 649 to 748 years old when it was consecrated in 1949."

Background information
Born	April 7, 1908 | Toronto, Ontario, Canada
Died	February 9, 1976 | (1976-02-09) |  (aged 67) | Encino, California, U.S.
Occupation(s)	Bandleader, orchestrator, composer

","To determine Percy Faith's age if he had died three months later in 1976, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Current Age**: First, calculate Percy Faith's age at the time of his actual death on February 9, 1976. He was born on April 7, 1908. By February 9, 1976, he had not yet reached his birthday that month, so he was 67 years old.

2. **Three Months Later**: If Percy Faith had died three months later, we add three months to February 9, 1976. This brings us to May 9, 1976.

3. **Age Calculation for May 9, 1976**: On May 9, 1976, Percy Faith would have turned 68 because he would have celebrated his birthday on April 7, 1976, and then reached 68 on May 9, 1976.

Therefore, if Percy Faith had died three months later in 1976, he would have been 68 years old.

Final Answer: Percy Faith would have been 68 years old."

","To determine how many years a judge can serve before a five-year extension is required, we need to follow these steps:

1. Identify the total term length: The judge term length is given as 75 years.

2. Determine when a five-year extension is needed: The extension can be requested once the judge reaches 75 years old.

3. Calculate the period before the extension: We need to subtract the age at which a judge can be appointed from the total term length.

   Term length: 75 years
   Age at appointment: 50 years

4. Perform the calculation:
   75 years (total term length) - 50 years (age at appointment) = 25 years

Therefore, a judge can serve for 25 years before a five-year extension is required.

","To determine how many years passed between the establishment of Italian Eritrea and the abolition of the Ethiopian Empire's monarchy, we need to identify the relevant dates from the information provided:

1. **Italian Eritrea**: The table indicates that Italian Eritrea was established on 3 October 1935.
2. **Monarchy Abolished**: The table shows that the monarchy was abolished on 21 March 1975.

Now, let's calculate the difference between these two dates:

1. **From 3 October 1935 to 31 December 1935**:
   - There are 99 days remaining in 1935 after 3 October.

2. **From 1 January 1975 to 21 March 1975**:
   - There are 71 days until 21 March.

Adding these together:
\[ 99 \text{ days} + 71 \text{ days} = 170 \text{ days} \]

However, since we are looking for the number of years, we need to convert this into years:
\[ \frac{170 \text{ days}}{365 \text{ days/year}} \approx 0.466 \text{ years} \]

Since we are asked for the number of years, and typically in such contexts, we consider whole years, we round up to the nearest whole year.

Therefore, the Italian Eritrea lasted approximately 39 years before the Ethiopian Empire's monarchy was abolished.

Final Answer: 39 years."

Key dates
3 November 1863	Opened as | Black Dog Siding
8 June 1953	Renamed | Black Dog Halt
20 September 1965	Closed

","To determine when Black Dog Halt fell into disuse, we need to look at the key dates provided in the table:

1. The table shows that Black Dog Halt was renamed from Black Dog Siding on 8 June 1953.
2. It was closed on 20 September 1965.

The term ""disused"" typically refers to something no longer in use or abandoned. In railway contexts, this often means the station has been closed.

Given these dates:
- The renaming happened in 1953.
- The closure occurred in 1965.

Since the station was closed in 1965, it would have fallen into disuse shortly after that date. Therefore, the correct answer is 20 September 1965.

Final Answer: Black Dog Halt fell into disuse on 20 September 1965."

1. Check the history section for any mentions of name changes.
2. Look for specific dates related to name changes.
3. Identify the earliest date where the name Black Dog Halt is mentioned.

Step 1: The history section states:
""3 November 1863 Opened as | Black Dog Siding""

Step 2: There are two relevant dates here - one for opening and one for renaming.

Step 3: The earliest date where Black Dog Halt is mentioned is 8 June 1953, which is the date it was renamed.

Therefore, Black Dog Halt first became known by that name on 8 June 1953.

","To determine the first operational date of Black Dog Halt, we need to follow these steps:

1. Identify the original name and opening date:
   - The table mentions ""Opened as | Black Dog Siding"" on 3 November 1863.
   - This was the initial name before it was renamed to Black Dog Halt.

2. Check if there's any information about operations under the original name:
   - There is no specific mention of when Black Dog Siding started operating, only its opening date.

3. Determine the renaming date:
   - The table states that it was renamed to Black Dog Halt on 8 June 1953.

4. Conclude based on available information:
   - Since the table doesn't provide an exact operational start date for Black Dog Siding, we can infer that the first operational date would be the same as its opening date.

Therefore, the first operational date of Black Dog Halt (originally Black Dog Siding) was 3 November 1863.

   - The table states: ""Orbiter: ~ 7.5 years (planned)""

2. Identify the elapsed mission duration:
   - The table states: ""2 years, 10 months (elapsed)""

3. Convert both durations to years for easier calculation:
   - Planned: 7.5 years (already in years)
   - Elapsed: 2 years + (10/12) years = 2 + 0.8333 ≈ 2.8333 years

4. Calculate the difference:
   - Difference = Planned duration - Elapsed duration
   - Difference = 7.5 - 2.8333 ≈ 4.6667 years

5. Round up to the nearest whole year:

","To determine how many years passed between the first flight and the first crewed flight of the Space Shuttle, we need to identify the dates for both events from the provided information:

1. First flight: ALT-12 | August 12, 1977 | (1977-08-12)
2. First crewed flight: STS-1 | April 12, 1981 | (1981-04-12)

Next, we calculate the difference between these two dates:

- The year for the first flight is 1977.
- The year for the first crewed flight is 1981.

To find the number of years between these two dates, we subtract the earlier year from the later year:

1981 - 1977 = 4 years

Therefore, the Space Shuttle's first crewed flight occurred 4 years after its first flight.

['Paul Gauguin 1891.png | Gauguin in 1891']

","To determine the age at which Paul Gauguin died, we need to follow these steps:

1. Identify the birth date of Paul Gauguin.
2. Identify the death date of Paul Gauguin.
3. Calculate the difference between the death date and the birth date.

Step 1: Paul Gauguin was born on 7 June 1848.

Step 2: Paul Gauguin died on 8 May 1903.

Step 3: To calculate his age at death:
- He died in 1903, which means he had already celebrated his birthday that year.
- We need to count from his birth year (1848) to the year he died (1903).

1903 - 1848 = 55 years

However, since he died in May (before his next birthday in June), he was not yet 55 years old.

Therefore, Paul Gauguin was 54 years old when he died.

Final Answer: Paul Gauguin died at the age of 54."

","Let's break this down step-by-step:
1. We need to find the date when the Russian ship was sold to India.
2. Looking at the ""History"" section, we see information about a Soviet/Russian ship named Admiral Gorshkov.
3. The history shows that this ship was laid down in 1978, launched in 1982, and commissioned in 1987.
4. The key information is in the next line: ""Sold to the Indian Navy on 20 January 2004""
5. This date corresponds to the event that would later become INS Vikramaditya.

","To determine the span in years between Ryan Hunter-Reay's first and last win on the IndyCar circuit, we need to identify these two events from the information provided in the table.

Step 1: Identify the first win on the IndyCar circuit.
- The table mentions that his first win was the 2008 Camping World Indy Grand Prix at the Glen (Watkins Glen).

Step 2: Identify the last win on the IndyCar circuit.
- The table states that his last win was the 2018 GoPro Grand Prix of Sonoma (Sonoma).

Step 3: Calculate the difference in years between the first and last wins.
- First win year: 2008
- Last win year: 2018
- Difference: 2018 - 2008 = 10 years

Therefore, the span in years between his first and last win on the IndyCar circuit is 10 years.

","To determine the year Jeffrey Epstein was first convicted of sex trafficking, we need to follow these steps:

1. Identify the relevant information from the table:
   - The table mentions ""Criminal charge"" which includes ""sex trafficking"".

2. Look for specific dates or years related to this charge:
   - There is no explicit mention of when he was first convicted of sex trafficking.

3. Consider the ""Date apprehended"":
   - The table states he was apprehended on July 6, 2019, but this doesn't indicate when he was first convicted.

4. Examine the ""Penalty"" section:
   - It mentions ""13 months with work release (2008)"".
   - This could potentially refer to a conviction in 2008, but it's not explicitly stated that it was for sex trafficking.

5. Check if there's any other information that might indicate the year of his first conviction:
   - No other information in the table directly states the year of his first conviction for sex trafficking.

Given the limited information provided, we cannot definitively state the year of Jeffrey Epstein's first conviction for sex trafficking based solely on the given table. However, the 13 months with work release in 2008 is the closest piece of information we have that might relate to a conviction, though it's not explicitly for sex trafficking.

Final Answer: The table does not provide a clear year for Jeffrey Epstein's first conviction of sex trafficking. The only related information is a 13-month sentence with work release in 2008, but this may or may not be for the sex trafficking charge."

","To determine the year of the first renovation of the Birmingham-Jefferson Convention Complex, we need to look at the information provided in the table.

Step 1: Identify the relevant information.
The table mentions ""Renovated"" and provides two dates: ""2009, 2019-21"".

Step 2: Analyze the dates.
- The year 2009 is mentioned separately.
- The range 2019-2021 indicates multiple renovations within this period.

Step 3: Determine which is the first renovation.
Since 2009 is listed before 2019-2021, it must be the first renovation.

Therefore, the first renovation of the Birmingham-Jefferson Convention Complex occurred in 2009.

","To determine the last television special featuring Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer, we need to identify all the TV specials mentioned in the table and their respective years.

1. First, let's list out the relevant information from the table:
   - Billie Mae Richards voiced Rudolph in TV specials from 1964 to 2010.
   - There is no specific mention of a year for ""Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer: The Movie"" or ""Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer and the Island of Misfit Toys,"" but they are listed under the ""Voiced by"" section, suggesting they are also TV specials.

2. Given that Billie Mae Richards voiced Rudolph until 2010, it implies that she was part of the last TV special featuring Rudolph before her voice acting ended.

3. Since there is no other specific information about the last TV special, we can conclude that the last TV special featuring Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer, based on the information provided, would be the one where Billie Mae Richards voiced him, which was up to 2010.

Therefore, the last television special featuring Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer, according to the given information, was in 2010.

","To determine the release year of the live version of ""3 a.m. Eternal,"" we need to follow these steps:

1. Identify which version of the song is considered the ""live"" version.
2. Find the release date for that specific version.

Step 1: Identifying the live version
From the given information, we can see two live versions mentioned:
- ""3 a.m. Eternal (Live at the S.S.L.)""
- ""3 a.m. Eternal (The KLF vs ENT version)""

The question specifically asks about the ""live version,"" so we'll focus on the first one.

- May 1989 (for the original version)
- 7 January 1991 (for the ""Live at the S.S.L."" version)
- January 1992 (for the ""The KLF vs ENT version"")

","To determine when OSC Metalist Stadium first opened, let's follow these steps:

1. Check the table for any direct mention of the stadium name ""Metalist Stadium.""
2. Look for information about when construction began or when the stadium was opened.
3. Verify if there's any mention of a previous name that might be relevant.

Step 1: The table caption mentions ""Metalist Stadium Kharkiv,"" which is consistent with the question.

Step 2: In the ""Construction"" section, we find:
- Broke ground: 1925
- Opened: 12 September 1926 | ; 95 years ago | ( | 1926-09-12 | )

Step 3: We also see former names listed:
- Tractor Stadium (1926-1940)
- Dzerzhinets Stadium (1940-1967)

However, these former names refer to different periods after the initial opening, not before it.

Based on this information, the stadium first opened on 12 September 1926.

","Let's break this down step-by-step:

1. The question asks about the release year of the movie ""Zoe Jane"".

2. However, there is no information provided about a movie called ""Zoe Jane"" in the given table.

3. The table does mention a song titled ""Zoe Jane"" under the singles from ""14 Shades of Grey"" album.
