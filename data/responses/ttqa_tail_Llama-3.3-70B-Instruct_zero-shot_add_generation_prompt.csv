","To find the next year after 2024 when Purim will be celebrated, we need to look at the pattern of dates provided for the previous years.

1. **Identify the Pattern**: The table provides specific dates for Purim celebrations from 2021 to 2024. These dates are:
   - 2021: Sunset, 25 February - nightfall, 26 February

   - 2023: Sunset, 6 March - nightfall, 7 March
   - 2024: Sunset, 23 March - nightfall, 24 March

2. **Understand the Jewish Calendar**: Purim is celebrated on the 14th day of Adar in the Jewish calendar, which is a lunisolar calendar. This means that the dates of Jewish holidays vary on the Gregorian calendar, which is the calendar used internationally and is based on the sun.

3. **Predicting Future Dates**: Since the Jewish calendar is lunisolar and includes an extra month every few years to keep it in sync with the solar year, predicting the exact date of Purim in future years without specific calculations or a conversion tool can be complex. However"

","To determine around which year the next orbital period of Neptune will begin, starting from the time of perihelion, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Identify the Time of Perihelion**: The table provides the time of perihelion as 2042-Sep-04. This is the starting point for our calculation.

2. **Understand Orbital Period**: The orbital period of Neptune, as given in the table, is 164.8 years. This is the time it takes for Neptune to complete one full orbit around the Sun.

3. **Calculate the Next Orbital Period Start**: To find when the next orbital period will begin, we need to add the orbital period to the time of perihelion. Since the orbital period is 164.8 years, we add this to 2042.

4. **Perform the Calculation**: 
   - Start year: 2042
   - Orbital period: 164.8 years
   - Next perihelion year = 2042 + 164.8

5. **Execute the Addition**:
   - 2042 + 164.8 = 2206.8

","To find the age at which Brian Lara played for Southern Rocks, we need to follow these steps:

1. Identify the year Brian Lara played for Southern Rocks.
2. Identify Brian Lara's birth year.
3. Calculate the age by subtracting the birth year from the year he played for Southern Rocks.

From the table, we can see that Brian Lara played for Southern Rocks in 2010.

We also know that Brian Lara was born on 2 May 1969.

Now, let's calculate his age in 2010:
2010 - 1969 = 41

Since Brian Lara was born on 2 May 1969, on 2 May 2010, he would have been 41 years old. However, he played for Southern Rocks in 2010, which could be before or after his birthday. 

Given that we don't have the exact dates of the matches he played for Southern Rocks, we can say he was either 40 or 41 years old during that time, depending on when exactly he played. However, since the question seems to be looking for a single answer and considering he would have spent most of 2010 being 41 (from May 2, 2010, onwards), we could reasonably conclude:

","To find the age at which Brian Lara played his last ODI, we need to follow these steps:

1. Identify the date of Brian Lara's last ODI.
2. Identify Brian Lara's birthdate.
3. Calculate the age based on these two dates.

Step 1: The date of Brian Lara's last ODI is given as 21 April 2007.

Step 2: Brian Lara's birthdate is given as 2 May 1969.

Step 3: To calculate the age at which Brian Lara played his last ODI, we subtract his birth year from the year of his last ODI and then consider the months and days.

- Year of last ODI: 2007
- Year of birth: 1969
- Age in years at the time of last ODI: 2007 - 1969 = 38 years

Since his last ODI was on 21 April 2007, and his birthday is on 2 May, at the time of his last ODI, he was still 37 years old, as he hadn't had his 38th birthday yet.

","To determine the age at which Chiyonofuji Mitsugu retired, we need to follow these steps:

1. Identify the birthdate of Chiyonofuji Mitsugu.
2. Identify the retirement date of Chiyonofuji Mitsugu.
3. Calculate the age at retirement by subtracting the birth year from the retirement year, considering the months for accuracy.

Step 1: Chiyonofuji Mitsugu's birthdate is June 1, 1955.

Step 2: Chiyonofuji Mitsugu retired in May 1991.

Step 3: To calculate the age at retirement, subtract the birth year from the retirement year and consider the months. Since Chiyonofuji Mitsugu was born in June 1955 and retired in May 1991, we subtract 1955 from 1991, which gives us 36 years. However, because he retired in May before his birthday in June, he was still 35 years old at the time of retirement.

","To determine the age at which Dhanraj Pillay played for Indian Gymkhana, we first need to establish the year he played for the team and his birth year.

1. **Identify the year Dhanraj Pillay played for Indian Gymkhana**: According to the table under ""Senior career"", Dhanraj Pillay played for Indian Gymkhana from 1992 to 1993.

2. **Identify Dhanraj Pillay's birth year**: From the ""Personal information"" section, we find that Dhanraj Pillay was born on July 16, 1968.

3. **Calculate the age**: Since Dhanraj Pillay played for Indian Gymkhana from 1992 to 1993, we calculate his age for both years.
   - In 1992, his age would be 1992 - 1968 = 24 years old.
   - In 1993, his age would be 1993 - 1968 = 25 years old.

Given that the question asks for the age at which he played and considering the duration of his play (1992-1993), Dhanraj Pillay was 24 to 25 years old when he played for Indian Gymkhana.

","To find out at what age Don Bradman joined his second domestic team, we first need to identify his second domestic team and the year he joined it. According to the table, his domestic teams were:

1. New South Wales (1927/28-1933/34)
2. South Australia (1935/36-1948/49)

So, his second domestic team was South Australia, which he joined in the 1935/36 season.

Next, we need to determine Don Bradman's age at that time. He was born on 27 August 1908. 

When he joined South Australia in 1935, we calculate his age as follows:
- If he joined at the beginning of the 1935/36 season (assuming around August or September 1935, given it's a cricket season which typically starts in the Southern Hemisphere's spring), his age would be approximately 27 years old, since his birthday (August 27) would have just passed or was about to occur.

Therefore, Don Bradman was approximately 27 years old when he joined his second domestic team, South Australia.

","To determine at what age Don Bradman played for the national side, we need to consider the information provided about his birthdate and the years he played for the national side.

1. **Birthdate**: Don Bradman was born on 27 August 1908.
2. **National Side Debut**: He made his Test debut for Australia on 30 November 1928.

Given this information, we calculate his age at the time of his debut as follows:

- Born: 27 August 1908
- Debut: 30 November 1928

From August 1908 to August 1928, Don Bradman would have been 20 years old. Since his debut was in November 1928, which is after August, we need to consider the additional months:

- August to November is 3 months.

Therefore, at the time of his debut on 30 November 1928, Don Bradman was 20 years old.

","To determine the age at which Don Bradman played his last Test, we need to follow these steps:

1. Identify the date of Don Bradman's last Test match.
2. Identify Don Bradman's birthdate.
3. Calculate the age of Don Bradman at the time of his last Test match.

Step 1: The date of Don Bradman's last Test match is given in the table as ""18 August 1948"".

Step 2: Don Bradman's birthdate is given in the table as ""27 August 1908"".

Step 3: To calculate the age, we subtract the birth year from the year of the last Test and then consider the months and days. 
- Don Bradman was born in 1908 and played his last Test in 1948, so he was 39 years old at the time of his last Test (1948 - 1908 = 40 years). However, since his birthday is on August 27 and his last Test was on August 18, he had not yet had his 40th birthday.

Therefore, when Don Bradman played his last Test on August 18, 1948, he was still 39 years old.

So, 1964 - 1945 = 19 years old.

Therefore, Eddy Merckx was 19 years old when he won the gold medal at the 1964 World Championships.

","To find the age at which Haguroyama Masaji retired, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Identify the retirement year**: According to the table, Haguroyama Masaji retired in September 1953.
2. **Identify the birth year**: His birth year is given as 1914.
3. **Calculate the age at retirement**: Subtract the birth year from the retirement year to find the age. However, since we are looking for the exact age, we also need to consider the months.

Given:
- Birthdate: November 18, 1914
- Retirement: September 1953

Since he retired in September 1953 and was born in November 1914, when he retired, he was not yet 39 years old because his birthday (November) had not arrived yet. 

The calculation:
1953 (retirement year) - 1914 (birth year) = 39 years

However, considering the months:
- He was born in November.
- He retired in September.

This means he was still 38 years old when he retired because he hadn't reached his 39th birthday yet.

However, because his birthday is in January and the Brazilian Grand Prix is typically held later in the year (often in November), we need to consider if he had his birthday before the race. Given that the race is after his birthday, he would have already turned 32 by the time of the race.

1. Identify the year Kimi Räikkönen won his first Formula One World Championship.
2. Determine Kimi Räikkönen's birth year.
3. Calculate the age by subtracting the birth year from the year he won the championship.

From the table, we can see that:
- Kimi Räikkönen won his first (and only mentioned) Formula One World Championship in 2007.
- Kimi Räikkönen was born on October 17, 1979.

So, when he won the championship in 2007, we calculate his age as follows:
- Since he was born in 1979, in 2007, he would be 28 years old (2007 - 1979 = 28).

Therefore, Kimi Räikkönen was 28 years old when he won his first Formula One World Championship.

1. Identify the year Sebastian Vettel won his first Italian Grand Prix. According to the table, his first win was at the ""2008 Italian Grand Prix"".

2. Identify Sebastian Vettel's birthdate. The table states he was born on ""3 July 1987"".

3. Calculate Sebastian Vettel's age at the time of his first Italian Grand Prix win. Since the win occurred in 2008, we subtract his birth year from the year of the win to get his age at the end of that year, but we must also consider the month of his birth and the month the Grand Prix took place.

The Italian Grand Prix typically takes place in September. Given that Sebastian Vettel was born in July 1987, when he won the Italian Grand Prix in 2008, he would have been 21 years old, because his 21st birthday would have occurred in July 2008, before the September race.

Therefore, Sebastian Vettel was 21 years old when he won his first Italian Grand Prix.

","To determine which year Sukkot occurs earliest in the year between 2021 and 2024, we need to compare the start dates of Sukkot for each of these years.

1. **2021 date**: Sunset, 20 September
2. **2022 date**: Sunset, 9 October
3. **2023 date**: Sunset, 29 September
4. **2024 date**: Sunset, 16 October

Now, let's compare these dates:

- September is earlier than October, so 2021's date (20 September) is the earliest.
- Among the October dates, 9 October (2022) is earlier than 16 October (2024) and 29 September (2023) is actually in September, making it earlier than all October dates but later than 2021's date.

Given this comparison, the year Sukkot occurs earliest in the year is 2021, as its start date (20 September) falls before the start dates of the subsequent years.

","To find out by how many days the Black Friday dates differed between 2022 and 2021, we need to compare the dates of Black Friday for these two years.

1. **Identify the Black Friday dates for 2021 and 2022:**
   - The Black Friday date for 2021 was November 26.
   - The Black Friday date for 2022 was November 25.

2. **Calculate the difference:**
   - To find the difference, we subtract the earlier date from the later date.
   - November 26, 2021, to November 25, 2022, is essentially moving one day back in the calendar from 2021 to 2022.

3. **Determine the number of days:**
   - Since Black Friday in 2022 was on November 25 and in 2021 it was on November 26, the difference is 1 day.

Therefore, the Black Friday dates differed by 1 day between 2022 and 2021.

","To find the year when Ciriello won the most overall gold medals, we need to examine the table for the years in which he won gold medals and count them for each year.

1. **Olympic Games**: Ciriello won a bronze medal in 2012, not a gold medal.
2. **World Cup**: He won a gold medal in 2014.
3. **Champions Trophy**: He won gold medals in 2010 and 2012.
4. **Commonwealth Games**: He won gold medals in 2010 and 2014.

Now, let's count the gold medals for each year:
- 2010: 2 gold medals (Champions Trophy and Commonwealth Games)
- 2012: 1 gold medal (Champions Trophy)
- 2014: 2 gold medals (World Cup and Commonwealth Games)

Based on this count, Ciriello won the most overall gold medals in the years 2010 and 2014, with both years having 2 gold medals.

Part of the | 2004 Atlantic hurricane season

","To determine the number of days Hurricane Gaston was over the water, we need to look at the formation and dissipation dates, as well as any information about when it made landfall.

1. **Formation Date**: Hurricane Gaston formed on August 27, 2004.
2. **Dissipation Date**: It dissipated on September 3, 2004.
3. **Landfall**: The table mentions that Hurricane Gaston moved ashore on August 29, which implies it made landfall on this date.

Given this information, we can calculate the time it spent over water as follows:

- From August 27 (formation) to August 29 (landfall) = 2 days over water before making landfall.
- After making landfall on August 29, it would eventually move back out to sea or dissipate. Since it dissipated on September 3, and there's mention of it being extratropical after September 1, we know it was still active after its initial landfall.

However, the critical piece of information for calculating the total days over water is recognizing that after the initial landfall on August 29, Gaston did indeed go back out to sea before finally dissipating. The exact date it went back"

1. **Formula One Career**: According to the table, Jenson Button was active in Formula One from 2000 to 2017. This means he was active in Formula One for 17 years.

2. **Super GT GT500 Career**: His debut season in Super GT GT500 was 2017, and there is no information provided in the table about him stopping, but since his last entry in Formula One was also in 2017, and considering he started in Super GT GT500 the same year, we can infer that 2017 marks a transition point in his career rather than an end. However, the information about his Super GT GT500 career does not extend beyond 2018, so we cannot definitively say how many years he was active in this series beyond that point.

1. The first system formed on July 14, 2002.
2. The last system dissipated on October 16, 2002.

Now, let's calculate the duration:

  - The season started on July 14, which means it was already 13 days into July when it began.
  - The season ended on October 16, which is 16 days into October.

Given this, the season started in the middle of July and ended before the end of October. 

To find out how long the season lasted in months, we consider the full months (August and September) that the season spanned, plus the partial months of July and October.

Since the first storm formed on July 14, the season effectively lasted from mid-July to mid-October, covering the full months of August and September, and parts of July and October.

Insurgency in Laos
Date	2 December 1975 - present
Location	Southern Laos (royalists and rightists); Central and Northern Laos (Hmong rebels)
Status	Ongoing low-intensity conflict | 2007 Hmong-led coup attempt against the Lao government foiled; alleged plotters tried and exonerated in the U.S.
['Part of the Third Indochina War']

Belligerents
Laos | Lao People's Revolutionary Party | Supported by | Vietnam (from 1976) | North Vietnam (until 1976) | Soviet Union (until 1989)	Hmong insurgents | Supported by | Thailand (until 1990) | United States (until 1990) | Neo Hom (1981-2007) | Royalists | Lao National Liberation Front | Royal Lao Democratic Government (1982) | Supported by | Royal Lao Government in Exile | China (until 1988) | Cambodia | Democratic Kampuchea (until 1979) | Cambodia | Khmer Rouge | Cambodia | Party of Democratic Kampuchea (1981-1990) | Rightists | United Front for the Liberation of Laos | Supported by | Thailand (early to mid-1980s)

","To find out how long the USA supported the Insurgency in Laos starting from 1975, we need to look at the duration of U.S. support as mentioned in the table.

1. The table mentions that the U.S. supported the Hmong insurgents.
2. It specifies that this support was ""until 1990"".
3. Since the starting point is 1975 (the beginning of the insurgency as per the table), we calculate the duration of support by subtracting the start year from the end year.

So, the calculation would be: 1990 (end year) - 1975 (start year) = 15 years.

Therefore, the USA supported the Insurgency in Laos for 15 years, starting from 1975.

","To determine how long the United Sabah Party (Parti Bersatu Sabah) has been affiliated with Barisan Nasional, let's break down the information provided in the table regarding their national affiliation.

1. The party was first affiliated with Barisan Nasional from 1985 to 1990. This period is 5 years.
2. Then, it was affiliated again from 2002 to 2018. This period is 16 years.
3. Additionally, it is mentioned that the party has been affiliated with Barisan Nasional again since 2021.

Given this information, we can calculate the total duration of affiliation with Barisan Nasional up to the current year (2022) as follows:

- The first affiliation period: 1985-1990 = 5 years
- The second affiliation period: 2002-2018 = 16 years
- The third affiliation period: 2021-2022 = 1 year (since the current year is 2022)

Adding these periods together: 5 years + 16 years + 1 year = 22 years

","To find out how long Sachin Tendulkar was a part of the national side, we need to look at the years he started and ended his career with the national team.

1. **Identify the start year**: Sachin Tendulkar made his Test debut on 15 November 1989, and his ODI debut on 18 December 1989, both against Pakistan. Since both debuts happened in 1989, we consider 1989 as the starting year of his international career.

2. **Identify the end year**: His last Test was on 14 November 2013, and his last ODI was on 18 March 2012. However, for calculating the total duration with the national side, we should consider the last year he played any form of international cricket, which was 2013 (the year of his last Test).

3. **Calculate the duration**: The duration of his career with the national side can be calculated by subtracting the starting year from the ending year.
   
   - Starting year: 1989
   - Ending year: 2013
   
   Duration = Ending year - Starting year = 2013 - 1989 = 24 years

","To find the number of Neptunian solar days in one Neptunian orbital period, we need to look at the information provided in the table under ""Orbital characteristics.""

1. **Identify the Orbital Period**: The orbital period of Neptune is given as 164.8 years, which can also be expressed in days as 60,195 days.

2. **Identify the Length of a Neptunian Solar Day**: The length of a Neptunian solar day (the time it takes for Neptune to rotate once on its axis relative to the Sun) is not directly given in the standard units of time like hours or days in the provided table. However, we are given the sidereal rotation period (the time it takes for Neptune to rotate once on its axis) as 0.6713 days, and the synodic rotation period (which accounts for the planet's motion around the Sun) as 0.67125 days (or 16 hours 6 minutes 36 seconds). For the purpose of calculating Neptunian solar days within an orbital period, the distinction between sidereal and synodic periods is crucial, but the provided synodic rotation period essentially gives us the Neptunian solar day.

","To answer this question, let's break it down into steps:

1. **Identify the launch date of I-179**: According to the table, I-179 was launched on 16 July 1942.

2. **Determine the sinking date of I-176**: However, the table does not provide information about the sinking date of I-176. It only mentions the fate of I-179, which was sunk during sea trials on 14 July 1943, and later salvaged and scrapped in 1957. There is no direct information about I-176's sinking date in 1942.

3. **Realize the information gap**: Since the table does not provide the sinking date of I-176 or even confirm if I-176 is indeed a sister ship of I-179 (though it can be inferred from the context that they might be part of the same class, given the similar naming convention), we cannot directly calculate the number of days after I-179's launch that I-176 was sunk.

4. **Conclusion based on available data**: Given the information provided in the table, we cannot accurately answer the question about how many days after being launched I-176 was sunk in 1942 because the specific sinking date of I"

","To determine how many days after formation Hurricane Ivan reached peak intensity, we need to establish two key dates: the date of formation and the date of peak intensity.

1. **Date of Formation**: According to the table, Hurricane Ivan formed on September 2, 2004.

2. **Date of Peak Intensity**: The table mentions that Hurricane Ivan was at peak intensity in the Yucatán Channel on September 13, 2004. This is the date we will use as the peak intensity date.

3. **Calculating the Difference**: To find out how many days after formation Ivan reached peak intensity, we subtract the formation date from the peak intensity date.
   - Formation date: September 2, 2004
   - Peak intensity date: September 13, 2004
   - Difference: September 13 - September 2 = 11 days

Therefore, Hurricane Ivan reached peak intensity 11 days after its formation.

Part of the | 2004 Atlantic hurricane season

","To find out how many days after forming it took for Hurricane Gaston to dissipate, we need to calculate the difference between the date it dissipated and the date it formed.

1. **Identify the formation date**: Hurricane Gaston formed on August 27, 2004.
2. **Identify the dissipation date**: Hurricane Gaston dissipated on September 3, 2004.
3. **Calculate the difference**: To find out how many days passed between these two dates, we calculate the difference.
   - August has 31 days, so from August 27 to August 31, there are 4 days.
   - September 3 is 3 days into September.
   - Therefore, the total number of days from August 27 to September 3 is 4 (remaining days in August) + 3 (days in September up to the 3rd) = 7 days.

So, it took 7 days after forming for Hurricane Gaston to dissipate.

","To find out how many days apart the Armenian Patriarchate of Jerusalem (non-O.S.) and the Armenian Apostolic Church celebrate Christmas, we need to look at the dates mentioned in the table for these two entities.

1. The Armenian Apostolic Church celebrates Christmas on January 6.
2. The Armenian Patriarchate of Jerusalem celebrates Christmas on January 19 (O.S. Jan. 6), but since we are considering the non-O.S. (New Style) date, we need to understand that the O.S. (Old Style) date of January 6 corresponds to a later date in the New Style calendar due to the difference in calendars. However, the specific non-O.S. date for the Armenian Patriarchate of Jerusalem is not directly provided, but we know it's January 19 in the O.S., which would be January 6 in the N.S. if it followed the typical 13-day difference between the Julian (O.S.) and Gregorian (N.S.) calendars around this time of year.

Adding these together: 6 days (remaining in December) + 7 days (in January up to the 7th) = 13 days.

Therefore, there are 13 days between the Christmas celebration of Western Christianity and the most common Oriental Orthodox celebration date.

","To find the number of days between the dates of National Election Day in 2023 and 2024, we need to follow these steps:

1. Identify the dates of National Election Day for 2023 and 2024 from the table.
2. Calculate the difference between these two dates.

From the table, we find that:
- The date for National Election Day in 2023 is November 7.
- The date for National Election Day in 2024 is November 5.

Now, let's calculate the difference:
- November 7, 2023, to November 5, 2024, is essentially moving from one November to the next, but since the day in 2024 (5th) is before the day in 2023 (7th), we consider the full months first and then account for the day difference.
- From November 7, 2023, to December 31, 2023, and then from January 1, 2024, to November 5, 2024, we are essentially counting a full year minus 2 days (since we move from the 7th back to the 5th in November).

","To determine the number of days the Deepavali festival, also known as Diwali, is celebrated in October, let's analyze the given information step by step:

1. **Identify the Dates**: The table provides specific dates for Diwali celebrations in 2022: October 21, 22, 23, 24, and 25.

2. **Understand the Celebrations**: Each date corresponds to a different aspect or day of the Diwali celebrations, such as Dhanteras, Naraka Chaturdashi, Lakshmi Puja, Govardhan Puja, and Bhai Dooj, among others.

3. **Count the Days**: Since the celebrations start on October 21 and end on October 25, we need to count the number of days included in this period.

   - October 21 (1st day)
   - October 22 (2nd day)
   - October 23 (3rd day)
   - October 24 (4th day)
   - October 25 (5th day)

4. **Conclusion**: By counting the individual days, we find that the Deepavali festival is celebrated over 5 days in October.

","To find out how many days later Mardi Gras started in 2022 compared to 2021, we need to compare the dates of Mardi Gras in 2021 and 2022.

1. The 2021 date of Mardi Gras is given as 16 February.
2. The 2022 date of Mardi Gras is given as 1 March.

Now, let's calculate the difference in days between these two dates.

- February has 28 days (29 in a leap year, but 2021 is not a leap year).
- So, from 16 February to the end of February, there are 28 - 16 = 12 days.
- March 1 is the day immediately after February, so we add the 12 days in February to the 1 day in March to get a total of 12 + 1 = 13 days after 16 February.

However, to accurately reflect the calculation:
- The date of Mardi Gras in 2021 is February 16.
- The date of Mardi Gras in 2022 is March 1.
- February has 28 days in 2021 (since it's not a leap year), so from February 16 to February"

","To find out how many days later Yom Kippur started in 2022 compared to 2021, let's first identify the start dates of Yom Kippur for both years.

1. **2021 Yom Kippur start date**: Sunset, 15 September
2. **2022 Yom Kippur start date**: Sunset, 4 October

Next, we calculate the difference in days between these two dates.

- September has 30 days, so from September 15 to September 30, there are 15 days.
- October 4 is 4 days into October.

Therefore, the total difference is 15 days (remaining in September) + 4 days (into October) = 19 days.

So, Yom Kippur in 2022 started 19 days later than in 2021.

","To find out how many days pass between Western Christianity's observance of Christmas and the Armenian Patriarchate of Jerusalem's observance, we need to determine the dates of Christmas for both Western Christianity and the Armenian Patriarchate of Jerusalem, and then calculate the difference.

1. **Western Christianity's Christmas Date**: According to the table, Western Christianity observes Christmas on December 25.

2. **Armenian Patriarchate of Jerusalem's Christmas Date**: The table states that the Armenian Patriarchate of Jerusalem observes Christmas on January 19 (O.S. Jan. 6). The ""O.S."" refers to the Old Style calendar, which is relevant for calculating the date according to the Julian calendar used by some Eastern Orthodox churches. However, for the purpose of calculating the difference in days as per the modern Gregorian calendar used internationally, we consider January 19 as the date.

3. **Calculating the Difference**: 
   - December has 31 days. So, from December 25 to December 31, there are 6 days.
   - January has 19 days until January 19. 
   - Therefore, the total number of days from December 25 to January 19 is 6 (remaining days in December) + 19 ("

","To find out how many months after being laid down HMS Argyll was commissioned, we need to calculate the time difference between the date it was laid down and the date it was commissioned.

1. **Laid down date**: HMS Argyll was laid down on 20 March 1987.
2. **Commissioned date**: It was commissioned on 31 May 1991.

Now, let's calculate the time difference:

- From March 1987 to March 1991, there are 4 years.
- Since HMS Argyll was laid down in March and commissioned in May, we need to add the months from March to May, which is 2 months.

So, the total time from being laid down to being commissioned is 4 years and 2 months.

To convert this into just months:
- 4 years = 4 * 12 = 48 months
- Adding the 2 months: 48 + 2 = 50 months

Therefore, HMS Argyll was commissioned 50 months after being laid down.

","To find out how many months after being ordered HMS Victory was laid down, we need to calculate the time difference between the order date and the laid-down date.

1. **Order Date**: HMS Victory was ordered on 14 July 1758.
2. **Laid Down Date**: It was laid down on 23 July 1759.

Now, let's calculate the time difference:

- From July 1758 to July 1759 is exactly 1 year.
- Since both months are July, the difference in months due to the year change is 12 months.
- However, we need to account for the days as well. HMS Victory was ordered on the 14th and laid down on the 23rd. This means it was laid down 9 days after the anniversary of its order.

So, the calculation considering just the months is 12 months, and since it was laid down 9 days later in the month, we don't need to add or subtract months for the day difference in this context, as the question asks for months.

Therefore, HMS Victory was laid down 12 months after being ordered.

","To find out how many months after launch the Mars orbiter insertion for ExoMars occurred, we need to calculate the time difference between the launch date and the orbital insertion date.

1. **Launch Date**: The launch date of ExoMars is given as 14 March 2016.
2. **Orbital Insertion Date**: The Mars orbiter insertion date is given as 19 October 2016.

Now, let's calculate the time difference:

- March to October is 7 months apart (since March is the 3rd month and October is the 10th month).
- However, we need to account for the days as well because the launch was on the 14th and the insertion was on the 19th.

From March 14th to March 31st = 17 days
April = 30 days
May = 31 days
June = 30 days
July = 31 days
August = 31 days
September = 30 days
October 1st to October 19th = 19 days

","To find out how many months after the 2022 celebration the 2024 celebration is, let's first identify the dates of the celebrations in 2022 and 2024.

The 2022 celebration of Purim is from Sunset, 16 March - nightfall, 17 March.
The 2024 celebration of Purim is from Sunset, 23 March - nightfall, 24 March.

Now, let's calculate the time difference between these two celebrations:

1. First, calculate the number of months from March 2022 to March 2024. Since they are in the same month but two years apart, this is exactly 2 years.

2. Since we are calculating the difference in months and there are 12 months in a year, we multiply the number of years by 12:
   2 years * 12 months/year = 24 months

So, the 2024 celebration of Purim is 24 months after the 2022 celebration.

","To determine how many months after the order the Tonnerre was laid down, we need to calculate the time difference between the date the ship was ordered and the date it was laid down.

1. The Tonnerre was ordered on 16 April 1794.
2. It was laid down on 22 September 1794.

Now, let's calculate the time difference:

- April to September is 5 months (since April is the 4th month and September is the 9th month of the year).
- Within April, the order was made on the 16th.
- Within September, the laying down occurred on the 22nd.

However, for simplicity and because the question asks for the number of months, we'll focus on the month difference primarily. The exact day difference within those months isn't critical for a month-based calculation.

Therefore, the Tonnerre was laid down approximately 5 months after it was ordered.

","To determine how many months ago Hurricane Ivan existed, we first need to establish the timeframe during which Hurricane Ivan was active and then calculate the difference between that time and the current date (December 2022).

1. **Identify the active period of Hurricane Ivan**: According to the table, Hurricane Ivan formed on September 2, 2004, and dissipated on September 25, 2004. This means it was active for approximately 23 days in September 2004.

2. **Calculate the time elapsed since Hurricane Ivan**: Given that the current date is December 2022, we need to calculate how many months have passed since September 2004.

- From September 2004 to September 2022, 18 years have passed. Since each year has 12 months, 18 years equal 18 * 12 = 216 months.
- From September 2022 to December 2022, an additional 3 months have passed.

3. **Add the months together**: 216 months (from September 2004 to September 2022) + 3 months (from September 2022 to December 2022) = 219 months.

Therefore, Hurricane Ivan existed 219 months ago.

2. Calculate the difference between the current date and the date identified in step 1.

From the table, we find that the Federal Defence Forces of Germany took on its current form on ""3 October 1990"".

Given that the current date is assumed to be December 2022, we can calculate the difference:

- Since 12 months make a year, 32 years = 32 * 12 = 384 months.
- However, we also need to account for the months within the year. 
  - October to December is 3 months (including December, excluding October).
  - So, from October 1990 to December 2022, it is 384 months (from the years) - 3 months (to account for being in December and the event happening in October) = 381 months, but considering the full years passed and then the portion of the year, the accurate calculation directly considers the full months passed.

","To determine how many months ago 3 Tevet was celebrated in 2021, let's break down the information step by step:

1. **Identify the Date of 3 Tevet in 2021**: According to the table, Hanukkah ends on either 2 Tevet or 3 Tevet. Since the 2021 dates for Hanukkah are given as Sunset, 28 November - nightfall, 6 December, and considering the Hebrew calendar dates provided (25 Kislev to 2 or 3 Tevet), we need to find out which Gregorian date corresponds to 3 Tevet in 2021.

2. **Hebrew to Gregorian Calendar Conversion for 2021**: The table mentions that Hanukkah in 2021 started on Sunset, 28 November, and ended on nightfall, 6 December. Given that Hanukkah lasts for eight days and starts on 25 Kislev, ending on either 2 Tevet or 3 Tevet, we can deduce that 3 Tevet would fall on the last day of the Hanukkah celebration in 2021, which is 6 December.

3. **Calculate Months from December 2022**: Since the question asks how many months ago"

","To determine how many months ago the Federal Defence Forces of Germany was founded, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Identify the founding date**: The Federal Defence Forces of Germany, also known as the Bundeswehr, was founded on November 12, 1955.

2. **Determine the current date**: We are assuming the current date is December 2022.

3. **Calculate the difference in years**: From November 1955 to December 2022, there are 67 years.

4. **Calculate the months**: Since there are 12 months in a year, we multiply the number of years by 12 to get the total number of months and then account for the difference in months from November to December.
   - 67 years * 12 months/year = 804 months
   - Since the founding month is November and the current month is December, we only need to consider the full months that have passed. The founding occurred in November, so by December of the same year, 1 month would have passed. Therefore, from December of the founding year to December 2022, we calculate the full months.

","To find out how many months ago the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) was founded, we need to calculate the time difference between the founding date and the current date.

1. **Founding Date of IDF**: The IDF was founded on May 26, 1948.
2. **Current Date**: Assuming the current date is December 2022.
3. **Calculation**:
   - From May 1948 to December 2022, there are 74 years (as given in the table).
   - Since 1 year has 12 months, 74 years would have 74 * 12 = 888 months.
4. **Adjusting for the Specific Dates**:
   - The IDF was founded in May, and we are calculating up to December of the same year (2022), which means we are 7 months into the year 2022 from the founding month (May to December).
   - Therefore, the exact calculation should consider the full years (74 years * 12 months/year) and then adjust for the months within the year 2022.

Given the information provided and the steps outlined, the calculation directly to months since founding without considering the specific start and end dates within the year would be:

","To find out how many months ago there were 215,263 confirmed cases, we need to calculate the time difference between the date when the confirmed cases were reported (25 October 2021) and the current date (assuming it's December 2022).

1. **Identify the dates**: The date of the confirmed cases report is 25 October 2021, and the current date is December 2022.

2. **Calculate the difference in years**: From 2021 to 2022, there is 1 year.

3. **Calculate the difference in months for the remaining part of the year**: 
   - October to December is 2 months (since we're considering the full months that have passed).

4. **Add the months from the year difference and the remaining months**: 
   - 1 year equals 12 months.
   - So, 12 months (from the year difference) + 2 months (from October to December) = 14 months.

Therefore, as of December 2022, it has been 14 months since there were 215,263 confirmed cases reported on 25 October 2021.

","To determine how many months it took for HMS Montrose to be commissioned after its launch, we first need to identify the launch and commissioning dates.

1. **Launch Date**: According to the table, HMS Montrose was launched on 31 July 1992.
2. **Commissioning Date**: The ship was commissioned on 2 June 1994.

Given these dates, we calculate the duration between the launch and commissioning:

- **Launch Year and Month**: 1992, July
- **Commissioning Year and Month**: 1994, June

From July 1992 to June 1994, there are approximately 2 years (24 months). However, since the question asks for the duration in months and seems to contain an error regarding the launch year (stating 2005, which is incorrect based on the provided information), we correct the understanding of the question to reflect the actual launch year of 1992.

Thus, the calculation is:
- From July 1992 to December 1992 = 5 months
- 1993 = 12 months
- From January 1994 to June 1994 = 6 months

Adding these together: 5 months + 12 months + 6 months = 23"

","To find out how many months the I-179 lasted after being completed, we need to determine the completion date and the date it was sunk or stricken, and then calculate the difference in months.

1. **Completion Date**: The I-179 was completed on 18 June 1943.
2. **Date Sunk or Stricken**: The I-179 was sunk during sea trials on 14 July 1943, but it was also mentioned that it was stricken on 15 April 1944. However, since the question asks for how long it lasted after being completed, the relevant date is when it was sunk, as that marks the end of its operational life, even though it was formally stricken later.

Now, let's calculate the difference in months:

- Completion date: 18 June 1943
- Sunk date: 14 July 1943

The I-179 lasted from June 18, 1943, to July 14, 1943, which is approximately 1 month, considering the completion and sinking dates.

","To find out how many months elapsed between the laying down and the launching of the Maori, we need to calculate the time difference between these two events.

1. The Maori was laid down on 6 July 1936.
2. The Maori was launched on 2 September 1937.

Now, let's calculate the time elapsed:

- From July 1936 to September 1936, it is 2 months (since July to August is 1 month and August to September is another month, but we are counting the full months, so we consider the month of launch, which makes it 2 months from July to September).
- Then, from September 1936 to September 1937, it is 12 months (a full year).

However, since we are counting from July 1936 to September 1937, we need to accurately account for the months:
- July 1936 to December 1936 = 5 months
- January 1937 to September 1937 = 9 months

Adding these together gives us a total of 14 months.

","To determine the age at which Dhanraj Pillay competed in his first Asian Games, we need to follow these steps:

1. Identify the year Dhanraj Pillay was born: According to the table, Dhanraj Pillay was born on July 16, 1968.
2. Identify the year of his first Asian Games: The table lists his participation in the Asian Games, with the earliest being in 1990 in Beijing.
3. Calculate his age at the time of his first Asian Games: Since he was born in 1968 and his first Asian Games were in 1990, we subtract his birth year from the year of the event to find his age. However, because his birthday is in July and the Asian Games in 1990 would have occurred before his July birthday (assuming the games took place earlier in the year), we need to consider if he had his birthday before or after the event.

Given the information:
- Born: July 16, 1968
- First Asian Games: 1990

If the 1990 Asian Games took place before July 16, 1990, Dhanraj Pillay would have been 21 years old at the time of the event. If the games took place after"

","To determine the age at which Jenson Button won his last Brazilian Grand Prix, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Identify the year of the last Brazilian Grand Prix win**: According to the table, Jenson Button's last win was at the 2012 Brazilian Grand Prix.

2. **Determine Jenson Button's birthdate**: The table states that Jenson Button was born on 19 January 1980.

3. **Calculate Jenson Button's age at the time of the last Brazilian Grand Prix win**: Since the last Brazilian Grand Prix win was in 2012, we subtract his birth year from the year of the win to get his age at the end of that year. However, because his birthday is in January and the Brazilian Grand Prix typically takes place later in the year, we need to consider if he had his birthday before or after the race in 2012.

4. **Consider the date of the 2012 Brazilian Grand Prix**: The 2012 Brazilian Grand Prix took place on 25 November 2012.

5. **Calculate the age**: Given that Jenson Button's birthday is on 19 January 1980, by the time the 2012 Brazilian Grand Prix occurred on 25 November 2012"

","To find out how many days after being launched the Maori was commissioned, we need to calculate the difference between the launch date and the commission date.

1. The Maori was launched on 2 September 1937.
2. The Maori was commissioned on 5 December 1938.

First, let's calculate the difference in days from 2 September 1937 to 31 December 1937:
- September has 30 days, so from 2 September to 30 September, there are 28 days.
- October has 31 days.
- November has 30 days.
- December has 31 days.
So, from 2 September 1937 to 31 December 1937, we have 28 (for September) + 31 (for October) + 30 (for November) + 31 (for December) = 120 days.

Then, for the year 1938, from 1 January to 5 December:
- January has 31 days.
- February has 28 days (since 1938 is not a leap year).
- March has 31 days.
- April has 30 days.
- May has 31 days.
- June has 30 days.
- July has 31 days.

","To determine the age at which Kimi Räikkönen entered his first Formula One World Championship, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Identify the year of the first Formula One World Championship entry**: According to the table, Kimi Räikkönen's first entry into the Formula One World Championship was at the ""2001 Australian Grand Prix.""

2. **Determine Kimi Räikkönen's birth year**: The table states that Kimi Räikkönen was born on ""17 October 1979.""

3. **Calculate Kimi Räikkönen's age at the time of his first Formula One World Championship entry**: Since his first entry was in 2001 and he was born in 1979, we subtract his birth year from the year of his first entry to find his age. However, because his birthday is in October and the Australian Grand Prix (the first race of the season) typically occurs in March, we need to consider if he had already had his birthday in 2001 when he entered his first championship.

Given that the 2001 Australian Grand Prix would have taken place before his 22nd birthday (since his birthday is in October), we calculate his age as follows:

","To find out how many more days were there between the Western and Eastern Easter dates in 2024 compared to 2022, let's break down the information:

1. **Identify the Easter dates for 2022 and 2024:**
   - In 2022, the Western Easter date was April 17, and the Eastern Easter date was April 24.
   - In 2024, the Western Easter date is March 31, and the Eastern Easter date is May 5.

2. **Calculate the difference in days between Western and Eastern Easter dates for each year:**
   - For 2022: April 24 (Eastern) - April 17 (Western) = 7 days.
   - For 2024: May 5 (Eastern) - March 31 (Western) = To calculate this, we need to consider the month change. March has 31 days, so from March 31 to April 30 is 30 days, and then add 5 days for May, which equals 35 days.

3. **Compare the differences:**

","To determine how many more months the ExoMars mission is planned to last, we need to calculate the difference between the planned mission duration and the elapsed time.

1. **Planned Mission Duration**: The planned mission duration is given as 7 years.

2. **Elapsed Time**: The elapsed time is given as 6 years, 3 months, and 18 days.

3. **Convert Planned Duration to Months**: Since there are approximately 12 months in a year, the planned duration in months is 7 years * 12 months/year = 84 months.

4. **Convert Elapsed Time to Months**: The elapsed time in months is 6 years * 12 months/year + 3 months = 72 months + 3 months = 75 months. The 18 days can be ignored for this calculation since we're dealing with months.

5. **Calculate Remaining Duration**: The remaining duration of the mission is the planned duration minus the elapsed duration, which is 84 months - 75 months = 9 months.

Therefore, the ExoMars mission is planned to last 9 more months.

3. **Calculate the difference in years**: To find out how many more years Richards played for the Leeward Islands than for Glamorgan, subtract the number of years he played for Glamorgan from the number of years he played for the Leeward Islands. So, 20 years (Leeward Islands) - 3 years (Glamorgan) = 17 years.

","To find out how many more years the Malayan Emergency lasted after the independence of the Federation of Malaya, we need to follow these steps:

1. Identify the date of the independence of the Federation of Malaya.
2. Identify the end date of the Malayan Emergency.
3. Calculate the difference between these two dates in years.

From the given information:
- The independence of the Federation of Malaya was on 31 August 1957.
- The Malayan Emergency ended on 31 July 1960.

Now, let's calculate the difference:
- The Malayan Emergency started after the independence, so we calculate from the date of independence (31 August 1957) to the end of the emergency (31 July 1960).
- From 1957 to 1960, there are 3 years. However, since the emergency ended in July and the independence was in August, it's less than a full 3 years after the independence.

Therefore, the Malayan Emergency lasted approximately 3 years after the independence of the Federation of Malaya, but since it ended a month before the anniversary of the independence, it's actually actually just under 3 years.

","To find out how many more years Valverde was with the Puente Tocinos team than with Illes Balears-Banesto, we need to calculate the number of years he spent with each team.

1. **Years with Puente Tocinos**: According to the table, Valverde was with Puente Tocinos from 1989 to 1998. So, he spent 1998 - 1989 = 9 years with Puente Tocinos.

2. **Years with Illes Balears-Banesto**: Valverde was with Illes Balears-Banesto from 2005 to 2010. So, he spent 2010 - 2005 = 5 years with Illes Balears-Banesto.

3. **Difference in years**: To find out how many more years he was with Puente Tocinos than with Illes Balears-Banesto, we subtract the years spent with Illes Balears-Banesto from the years spent with Puente Tocinos. So, 9 years (Puente Tocinos) - 5 years (Illes Balears-Banesto) = 4 years.

","To find the total number of years Kimi Räikkönen competed, we need to look at both his Formula One World Championship career and his World Rally Championship record.

1. **Formula One Career**: The table states that Kimi Räikkönen was active in Formula One from 2001 to 2009 and then again from 2012 to 2021. 
   - The first period (2001-2009) encompasses 9 years.
   - The second period (2012-2021) encompasses 10 years.
   - So, in total for Formula One, he competed for 9 + 10 = 19 years.

2. **World Rally Championship Career**: The table mentions that he was active in the World Rally Championship from 2009 to 2011.
   - This period encompasses 3 years.

However, there's an overlap in 2009, as he competed in both Formula One and the World Rally Championship that year. Therefore, we should not double-count 2009.

- Total years in Formula One: 19 years
- Total years in World Rally Championship: 3 years
- Overlap (year 2009): 1 year

","To find the total number of years Michael Schumacher was active in his career, we need to consider both his Formula One World Championship career and his 24 Hours of Le Mans career.

1. **Formula One World Championship career**: The table states that his active years in Formula One were from 1991 to 2006 and then again from 2010 to 2012. This can be broken down into two periods:
   - The first period is from 1991 to 2006, which includes 16 years (2006 - 1991 + 1 = 16).
   - The second period is from 2010 to 2012, which includes 3 years (2012 - 2010 + 1 = 3).
   - So, in total for Formula One, he was active for 16 + 3 = 19 years.

2. **24 Hours of Le Mans career**: It's mentioned that he participated in the 24 Hours of Le Mans in 1991. This adds 1 year to his total active years in racing.

3. **Combining both careers**: Since the year 1991 is counted in both careers, we should not double-count it. Therefore, we simply add the total years"

1. **Year Dhyan Chand joined the military:** According to the table, Dhyan Chand's ""Years of service"" in the military were from 1922 to 1956. Therefore, he joined the military in 1922.

2. **Year Dhyan Chand's hockey career began:** The table mentions his field hockey career in the context of his national team appearances. It states that he played for British India from 1926 to 1949. Thus, his hockey career at the national level began in 1926.

3. **Calculating the difference:** To find out how many years after joining the military his hockey career began, we subtract the year he joined the military from the year his hockey career started. So, 1926 - 1922 = 4 years.

Therefore, Dhyan Chand's hockey career began 4 years after he joined the military.

","To find out how many years after FAT was GUNT an Anti-Libyan Chadian faction, we need to determine the years during which FAT and GUNT were active as Anti-Libyan Chadian factions.

1. **Identify the years FAT was active as an Anti-Libyan Chadian faction**: According to the table, FAT was active from 1978 to 1979.

2. **Identify the years GUNT was active as an Anti-Libyan Chadian faction**: The table indicates that GUNT was active from 1986 to 1987 as an Anti-Libyan Chadian faction. Before this, from 1979 to 1986, GUNT was a Pro-Libyan Chadian faction.

3. **Calculate the difference in years**: Since FAT was active until 1979 and GUNT became an Anti-Libyan faction in 1986, we calculate the difference from the end of FAT's activity (1979) to the beginning of GUNT's activity as an Anti-Libyan faction (1986).

","To find out how many years after HMS Montrose was ordered it was launched, we first need to identify the year it was ordered and the year it was launched.

1. According to the table, HMS Montrose was ordered in July 1988, not in 2005 as mentioned in the question. This discrepancy is crucial because it changes the basis of our calculation entirely.
2. The launch year of HMS Montrose, as per the table, was 31 July 1992.

Given the correct information:
- Ordered: July 1988
- Launched: July 1992

We calculate the difference in years between these two dates:
1992 - 1988 = 4 years

Therefore, HMS Montrose was launched 4 years after it was ordered. The mention of 2005 in the question seems to be an error since the table clearly states the order was made in 1988.

","To find out how many years after being laid down HMS Somerset launched, we need to look at the dates provided for when it was laid down and when it was launched.

1. **Laid down date**: The table states that HMS Somerset was laid down on 12 October 1992.
2. **Launched date**: It was launched on 25 June 1994.

Now, let's calculate the time difference between these two dates:

- From 12 October 1992 to 31 December 1992, there are approximately 2.5 months.
- The year 1993 is a full year.
- From 1 January 1994 to 25 June 1994, there are approximately 6 months.

Adding these together, we get:
- 2.5 months (end of 1992) + 12 months (1993) + 6 months (first half of 1994) = 20.5 months

Since there are 12 months in a year, 20.5 months is equivalent to approximately 1 year and 8.5 months.

1. The I-179 was laid down on 21 August 1941.
2. The I-179 was completed on 18 June 1943.

Now, let's calculate the time difference:
- From August 1941 to August 1942, it is 1 year.
- From August 1942 to June 1943, it is approximately 10 months.

Since 10 months is less than a year, we can conclude that the I-179 was completed approximately 1 year and 10 months after it was laid down. However, the question seems to ask for the answer in years, so we consider the whole years passed.

Therefore, the I-179 was completed almost 2 years after being laid down, but since it's less than 2 full years, we can say it was completed about 1 year and 10 months after. However, given the format of possible answers and the nature of the question, the closest interpretation in years would be to consider it as approximately 2 years, but since the exact calculation gives us 1"

","To answer the question, we first need to establish when the HMS Astute was ordered and then determine the year the picture (referred to as ""Astute Crest.jpg"") was taken, assuming that's what is meant by ""the picture."" However, the table does not provide a specific date for when the picture was taken. 

Given the information provided in the table:
1. The HMS Astute was ordered in March 1997.
2. There's no explicit mention of when the picture (Astute Crest.jpg) was taken.

Since we don't have the exact date the picture was taken, we cannot directly calculate the number of years after the HMS Astute was ordered that the picture was taken. The table provides various dates related to the construction, launch, and commissioning of the HMS Astute but does not specify the date of the picture.

Without the specific date of the picture, we cannot accurately answer the question as it stands.

3. Calculate the difference between these two dates in years.

Step 1: The Malayan Emergency started on 16 June 1948.

Step 2: Clement Attlee was already the leader when the Malayan Emergency began, as he is listed as the leader of the United Kingdom ""until 1951"". This means he was the leader from before the start of the Malayan Emergency and continued until 1951.

Step 3: Since Clement Attlee was the leader from before the Malayan Emergency began, the question of how many years after it began he became a leader doesn't apply in the context of him starting his leadership role after the emergency began. Instead, he was already in his role.

However, based on the information given and the way the question is phrased, it seems to be asking for how long after the Malayan Emergency started did Attlee remain as a leader before being succeeded, which would be until 1951.

","To find out how many years after the founding of the Republic of Korea Armed Forces the Vietnam War was, we need to follow these steps:

1. Identify the founding year of the Republic of Korea Armed Forces.
2. Identify the years during which the Vietnam War took place.
3. Calculate the difference between the start year of the Vietnam War and the founding year of the Republic of Korea Armed Forces.

Step 1: The founding year of the Republic of Korea Armed Forces is given as 1948.

Step 2: The Vietnam War took place from 1965 to 1973.

Step 3: To find out how many years after the founding the Vietnam War started, we subtract the founding year from the start year of the Vietnam War: 1965 - 1948 = 17 years.

Therefore, the Vietnam War started 17 years after the founding of the Republic of Korea Armed Forces.

Insurgency in Laos
Date	2 December 1975 - present
Location	Southern Laos (royalists and rightists); Central and Northern Laos (Hmong rebels)
Status	Ongoing low-intensity conflict | 2007 Hmong-led coup attempt against the Lao government foiled; alleged plotters tried and exonerated in the U.S.
['Part of the Third Indochina War']

Belligerents
Laos | Lao People's Revolutionary Party | Supported by | Vietnam (from 1976) | North Vietnam (until 1976) | Soviet Union (until 1989)	Hmong insurgents | Supported by | Thailand (until 1990) | United States (until 1990) | Neo Hom (1981-2007) | Royalists | Lao National Liberation Front | Royal Lao Democratic Government (1982) | Supported by | Royal Lao Government in Exile | China (until 1988) | Cambodia | Democratic Kampuchea (until 1979) | Cambodia | Khmer Rouge | Cambodia | Party of Democratic Kampuchea (1981-1990) | Rightists | United Front for the Liberation of Laos | Supported by | Thailand (early to mid-1980s)

","To solve this, let's break down the information provided:

1. The insurgency in Laos began on 2 December 1975.
2. The Soviet Union (which is essentially the predecessor to modern Russia) was a supporter of the Lao People's Revolutionary Party.
3. The Soviet Union's support is noted as being ""until 1989"".

Given this information, we need to calculate how many years after the insurgency began did the Soviet Union (and by extension, Russia, in its former incarnation) cease being a belligerent.

The insurgency started in 1975, and the Soviet Union's involvement ended in 1989. 

So, to find out how many years after the start of the insurgency the Soviet Union ceased its involvement, we subtract the start year from the end year:

1989 - 1975 = 14 years

Therefore, Russia (as the Soviet Union at the time) ceased being a belligerent 14 years after the insurgency began.

","To find out how many years after the last year of Cominform affiliation the League of Communists of Yugoslavia was dissolved, let's break down the information provided:

1. The last year of Cominform affiliation for the League of Communists of Yugoslavia was 1948.
2. The League of Communists of Yugoslavia was dissolved on 22 January 1990.

Now, let's calculate the difference between these two years:

1990 (year of dissolution) - 1948 (last year of Cominform affiliation) = 42 years

Therefore, the League of Communists of Yugoslavia was dissolved 42 years after the last year of its Cominform affiliation.

1. **Dates of Operation for Fatah - The Revolutionary Council**: The organization started operating in 1974.
2. **Allies of Fatah - The Revolutionary Council**: Syria is listed as an ally from 1979 to 1985.

Given this information, we can calculate the number of years after the operation began that Syria became an ally:

- **Start of Operation**: 1974
- **Syria Became an Ally**: 1979

**Calculation**: 1979 - 1974 = 5 years

Therefore, Syria became an ally 5 years after the operation of Fatah - The Revolutionary Council began.

","To solve this, let's break down the information provided in the table regarding the operation of Fatah - The Revolutionary Council and its alliance with Iraq.

1. **Dates of Operation for Fatah - The Revolutionary Council**: The table indicates that the organization operated from 1974 to 1997.

2. **Alliance with Iraq**: According to the table, Iraq was an ally of Fatah - The Revolutionary Council from 1974 to 1978 and then again from 1991 to 2002.

Given these points, we're interested in the period after Fatah - The Revolutionary Council ended its operation in 1997 and how long Iraq remained an ally after this date.

- Fatah - The Revolutionary Council stopped operating in 1997.
- Iraq's second period of alliance started in 1991 and ended in 2002.

So, from 1997 (when Fatah's operation ended) to 2002 (when the alliance with Iraq ended), there are 5 years.

Therefore, Iraq remained an ally for 5 years after the operation of Fatah - The Revolutionary Council ended.

1. **Identify the year of the event mentioned in the table:** The table mentions the ""IBSF World Championships 2017."" This indicates that the specific championships being referred to took place in 2017.

2. **Determine the current year:** We are given that the current date is December 2022.

","To find out how many years ago the sister ship I-176 was salvaged and scrapped, we first need to identify the salvage and scrap date of I-176. However, the table provided only gives information about I-179, not I-176. Since we cannot directly find the information about I-176 from the given table, let's proceed with the assumption that the question might be indirectly referring to the information provided for I-179, considering the lack of direct data on I-176.

Given that the table mentions I-179 was salvaged and scrapped in 1957, and assuming the question intends to use I-179 as a reference point due to the absence of specific details on I-176, we calculate the years from 1957 to the current year (2022) as follows:

2022 - 1957 = 65 years

Therefore, if we were to consider I-179 as the basis for our calculation due to the information provided, the salvage and scrapping would have occurred 65 years ago.

Final Answer: The question cannot be directly answered with the provided information about I-176, but based on the details for I-179, it would be 65 years ago."

","To find the number of years between Barrichello's best finish in his Stock Car Brasil career and his best finish in his IndyCar Series career, let's identify the years of these best finishes first.

1. **Best finish in Stock Car Brasil career**: Barrichello's best finish in the Stock Car Brasil championship was 1st, which occurred in 2014.
2. **Best finish in IndyCar Series career**: His best finish in the IndyCar Series championship was 12th, which occurred in 2012.

Now, let's calculate the difference in years between these two events:

- Year of best finish in Stock Car Brasil: 2014
- Year of best finish in IndyCar Series: 2012

The difference in years = 2014 - 2012 = 2 years.

Therefore, there are 2 years between Barrichello's best finish in his Stock Car Brasil career and his best finish in his IndyCar Series career.

Last updated: May 2022.

","To find the number of years between Farag winning gold at the Cairo World Championships and at the Marseille World Team Championships, we need to determine the years in which these events occurred.

1. **Cairo World Championships**: According to the table, Farag won gold at the Cairo World Championships in 2021-22. Since the question is about the year and considering the format of the date (2021-22), it implies the event took place in 2022, as World Championships are typically held at the end of one year or the beginning of the next, and the season format suggests the latter part of the range is the year of occurrence.

2. **Marseille World Team Championships**: Farag won gold at the Marseille World Team Championships in 2017.

3. **Calculating the Difference**: To find the number of years between these two events, we subtract the earlier year from the later year.
   - Year of Cairo World Championships: 2022
   - Year of Marseille World Team Championships: 2017
   - Difference: 2022 - 2017 = 5 years

Therefore, there are 5 years between Farag winning gold at the Cairo World Championships and at the Marseille World Team Championships.

2. Since 2017 is mentioned as the year before 2019 in this context, we can infer that the previous World Aquatics Championships took place in 2017.

3. To find out how many years before 2019 the 2017 championships occurred, we subtract 2017 from 2019.

4. 2019 - 2017 = 2 years.

Therefore, the previous World Aquatics Championships occurred 2 years before the 2019 World Aquatics Championships.

","To find out how many years Jenson Button raced, we need to look at the duration of his career in both Formula One and Super GT GT500 Championship.

1. **Formula One Career**: According to the table, Jenson Button's active years in Formula One were from 2000 to 2017. This means he was active in Formula One for 17 years (2017 - 2000 = 17).

2. **Super GT GT500 Championship Career**: His debut season in the Super GT GT500 Championship was 2017. Although the table does not specify the last year he participated in this championship, it mentions that he achieved his best finish (1st) in 2018. Since there's no information provided about his participation beyond 2018, we can at least confirm he was active in this championship for 2 years (2017 and 2018).

However, the question seems to be asking for the total duration of his racing career, not necessarily split by the type of championship. Given that his Formula One career ended in 2017 and he started in the Super GT GT500 Championship in the same year, there's an overlap, and he continued racing into 2018.

1. **Identify the start year of the senior career**: The earliest year mentioned in the senior career section is ""0000 | -2005"" for Club Egara.

The exact start year is not provided, but we know he played for the national team starting from 2003, which gives us a clue about when his senior career might have begun.

2. **Calculate the total years played in the senior division**: Given that Pau Quemada's senior career started at least by 2003 (when he started playing for the national team) and considering the years he played for different clubs:
   - He played until 2021, as indicated by ""2003-2021 | Spain | 293 | (119)"" in the national team section.

1. **Identify the start year**: The ""Test debut"" information indicates that Sachin Tendulkar started playing for the national side on 15 November 1989. Therefore, the start year is 1989.

","To find out how many years Viv Richards played for the West Indies, we need to look at the information provided in the ""International information"" section of the table.

1. **Identify the start year**: The ""Test debut"" information tells us when Viv Richards first started playing for the West Indies. According to the table, his Test debut was on ""22 November 1974 v India"". This means he started playing for the West Indies in 1974.

2. **Identify the end year**: The ""Last Test"" and ""Last ODI"" information tells us when Viv Richards last played for the West Indies. The table states his ""Last Test"" was on ""8 August 1991 v England"" and his ""Last ODI"" was on ""27 May 1991 v England"". Since both of these events occurred in 1991, we can conclude that 1991 was the last year he played for the West Indies.

3. **Calculate the number of years played**: To find out how many years Viv Richards played for the West Indies, we subtract the start year from the end year and then add 1 (since we are counting the years inclusively). 

   - Start year: 1974

","To determine the number of years it took for HMS Somerset to be commissioned after being ordered, we need to look at the dates provided in the table for when the ship was ordered and when it was commissioned.

1. The ship was ordered in January 1992.
2. The ship was commissioned on 20 September 1996.

Now, let's calculate the time difference:

- Starting from January 1992 to December 1992 is 1 year.
- Then, from January 1993 to December 1995 is 3 years.
- Finally, from January 1996 to September 1996 is approximately 9 months.

Adding these together, 1 year + 3 years + (approximately 9 months), we can consider the 9 months as a fraction of a year, but since the question seems to be asking for a whole number, we'll round it. However, the exact calculation is closer to 4 years and 9 months.

But if we are to follow the typical way of counting years without considering the fractions of a year unless explicitly asked for, we might simply say it took approximately 4 years and 9 months, which could be misinterpreted as needing to be rounded.

","To find out how many years it took for the Ba'ath Brigades to become the paramilitary wing of the Arab Socialist Ba'ath Party – Syria Region, we first need to identify the year the Ba'ath Brigades were established and the year they stopped being the paramilitary wing, as this will give us the duration they served in this role.

1. **Identify the establishment and dissolution years of the Ba'ath Brigades**: According to the table, the Ba'ath Brigades were active from 2012 to 2018.

2. **Calculate the duration**: The difference between 2018 and 2012 gives us the number of years the Ba'ath Brigades were active as the paramilitary wing of the party.

2018 - 2012 = 6 years

Therefore, it took the Ba'ath Brigades 6 years to serve as the paramilitary wing of the Arab Socialist Ba'ath Party – Syria Region, not to ""become"" the paramilitary wing, as the question might imply a process of transformation or a period of waiting to achieve this status.

","To find out how many years it took the Saudi Arabian Armed Forces to deploy personnel to Yemen after deploying to Bahrain, we need to look at the dates of deployment for both countries.

1. **Identify the deployment dates**: 
   - Deployment to Bahrain: 14 March 2011
   - Deployment to Yemen: 26 March 2015

2. **Calculate the difference in years**:
   - The difference between 2015 and 2011 is 4 years.

3. **Consider the exact dates**:
   - Since the deployment to Bahrain was on March 14, 2011, and the deployment to Yemen was on March 26, 2015, it's slightly more than 4 years because the deployment to Yemen happened about 12 days after the anniversary of the deployment to Bahrain.

4. **Conclusion**: It took approximately 4 years for the Saudi Arabian Armed Forces to deploy personnel to Yemen after deploying to Bahrain.

","To determine how many years the Defence Force lasted before its current form, we need to find the difference between the year it was founded and the year it took its current form.

1. The Defence Force was founded on 12 November 1955.
2. It took its current form on 3 October 1990.

Now, let's calculate the difference in years between these two dates:

1. The start year of the First Lebanon War is given as 1982.
2. The end year of the First Lebanon War is given as 1985.

","To determine the duration of the First Sudanese Civil War in years, we need to look at the start and end dates provided in the table.

1. The war started on 18 August 1955.
2. The war ended on 27 March 1972.

Now, let's calculate the duration:
- The war started in 1955 and ended in 1972.
- To find the number of years, we subtract the start year from the end year: 1972 - 1955 = 17 years.

However, we also need to consider the months and days to ensure accuracy. 
- The war started on August 18, 1955, and ended on March 27, 1972.
- Since August comes after March in the calendar, the difference in months and days indicates that the war did not complete a full 17-year cycle from March to March or August to August but rather from August to March, which is less than a full year cycle from the start of the year.

Given the specific duration mentioned in the table as ""(16 years, 7 months, 1 week and 2 days)"", we can directly use this information for accuracy.

1. **Identify the relevant information**: The table mentions the Second Liberation Army under the ""Belligerents"" section, stating it was active from 1968 to 1976.

2. **Calculate the duration**: To find out how many years the Second Liberation Army existed, we subtract the starting year from the ending year.
   - Starting year: 1968
   - Ending year: 1976
   - Duration = Ending year - Starting year = 1976 - 1968 = 8 years

Therefore, the Second Liberation Army existed for 8 years.

","To determine how many years the Tonnerre sailed before it was burned down, let's look at the key dates provided in the table:

1. The Tonnerre was launched on 9 June 1808.
2. It was commissioned on 21 July 1808.
3. The Tonnerre was burned and exploded on 12 April 1809.

Given these dates, we can calculate the duration it was in service. Since it was commissioned in July 1808 and burned in April 1809, it was less than a year in service. 

To be precise, from July 1808 to April 1809 is approximately 9 months. However, since the question seems to ask for the answer in years and given the options might not account for months, we consider it as less than a year. But since the question specifically asks for ""years,"" the answer would technically be ""less than 1 year"" because it did not complete a full year of service.

","To find out how many years elapsed between Merckx's first General Classification win and his last Combination Classification win at the Tour de France, let's break down the information provided:

1. **First General Classification win at the Tour de France**: According to the table, Merckx's first General Classification win at the Tour de France was in 1969.

2. **Last Combination Classification win at the Tour de France**: The table also shows that Merckx won the Combination Classification at the Tour de France in the years 1969, 1970, 1971, 1972, and 1974. Therefore, his last Combination Classification win was in 1974.

Now, let's calculate the years elapsed between these two events:

- **First event (General Classification win)**: 1969
- **Last event (Combination Classification win)**: 1974

The difference between 1974 and 1969 is 5 years.

Therefore, the number of years that elapsed between Merckx's first General Classification win and his last Combination Classification win at the Tour de France is 5 years.

","To find out how many years elapsed from when Dhanraj Pillay won his first medal in Kuala Lumpur to his last in Kuala Lumpur, we need to identify the years of these events based on the information provided in the table.

1. **First Medal in Kuala Lumpur**: The table mentions Dhanraj Pillay winning medals in Kuala Lumpur in the context of the Asia Cup and the Champions Challenge. The earliest mention of a medal won in Kuala Lumpur is the Bronze medal at the 1999 Asia Cup. However, since the question implies a comparison with a later event in Kuala Lumpur, we should also consider the Champions Challenge and other Asia Cup events held in Kuala Lumpur.

2. **Last Medal in Kuala Lumpur**: The latest mention of Dhanraj Pillay winning a medal in Kuala Lumpur is at the 2003 Asia Cup, where he won a Gold medal.

Given these points, the calculation for the elapsed years would be from 1999 (the first mention of a medal in Kuala Lumpur, assuming this is the first relevant medal) to 2003 (the last mention of a medal in Kuala Lumpur).

- **First Year**: 1999

","To find out how many years had passed since the creation of the Israel Defense Forces before the Sinai War, we need to follow these steps:

1. Identify the year the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) was founded.
2. Identify the year the Sinai War took place.
3. Subtract the founding year of the IDF from the year the Sinai War occurred to find the difference in years.

Step 1: The Israel Defense Forces was founded on 26 May 1948.

Step 2: The Sinai War took place in 1956.

Step 3: To find out how many years had passed since the IDF's creation before the Sinai War, we subtract 1948 from 1956.

1956 - 1948 = 8

Therefore, it had been 8 years since the creation of the Israel Defense Forces before the Sinai War.

1. The New Order's active years are given as 1957-1973.
2. The National Vanguard's active years are given as 1960-1976.

Given that the National Vanguard joined in 1960, we can calculate the number of years the New Order had been active by subtracting the start year of the New Order from the join year of the National Vanguard.

So, 1960 (the year the National Vanguard joined) - 1957 (the year the New Order started) = 3 years.

Therefore, the New Order had been fighting for 3 years when the National Vanguard joined.

2. **Understand the Information Provided**: The table gives detailed information about HMS Somerset, including its commissioning date (20 September 1996) and its current status (in active service). However, this information pertains to HMS Somerset, not HMS Astute.

3. **Recognize the Lack of Information on HMS Astute**: The table does not mention HMS Astute at all. Therefore, we cannot calculate how many years HMS Astute has been in service based on the information given.

4. **Conclusion**: Since the table does not provide any information about HMS Astute, we cannot determine how many years it has been in service with the UK Navy based on the data provided.

Final Answer: The information provided does not allow for the calculation of how many years HMS Astute has been in service."

","To find out how many years Pau Quemada has been playing in his senior career, we need to look at the information provided in the ""Senior career"" section of the table.

1. The earliest year mentioned for his senior career is ""0000 | -2005"" with Club Egara. Since the start year is not specified, we can't determine the exact starting point, but we know he was playing by 2005.
2. The latest year mentioned is ""2021-present"" with Leuven, indicating he is still active.

Given this information, we can calculate the duration of his senior career by subtracting the year he started from the current year (2022, since we're considering up to December 2022) or the last year mentioned for his career (2021), but since he is still active, we'll consider up to 2022 for a more accurate calculation.

However, the exact start year is not provided, making it challenging to calculate the precise number of years. But we can estimate based on the information given:

- If we consider his senior career starting from 2005 (the year he left Club Egara) to 2022, that would be approximately 17 years.

","To find out how many years the Australian Defence Force has been in its current form, we need to follow these steps:

1. Identify the date when the Australian Defence Force took its current form.
2. Calculate the difference between the current year (2022) and the year the Australian Defence Force took its current form.

From the table, we can see that the Australian Defence Force took its current form on 9 February 1976.

Now, let's calculate the difference:
2022 (current year) - 1976 (year of current form) = 46 years

Since the current form started on February 9, 1976, and considering the current year is 2022, by February 9, 2022, it would have been 46 years. However, since we are in December 2022, the calculation remains accurate as the difference is calculated in years, not accounting for the exact dates within those years for this type of question.

","To find out how many years longer the Arab Socialist Ba'ath Party has existed than its paramilitary wing, we first need to establish the founding year of both entities and then calculate the difference.

1. The founding year of the Arab Socialist Ba'ath Party is 1947.
2. The paramilitary wing, known as the Ba'ath Brigades, existed from 2012 to 2018.

Given that the Ba'ath Brigades existed for 6 years (from 2012 to 2018), we calculate the difference in existence between the party and its paramilitary wing as follows:

- The party was founded in 1947.
- By 2012, when the Ba'ath Brigades were formed, the party had already existed for 65 years (2012 - 1947 = 65 years).
- Since the Ba'ath Brigades existed for 6 years, we need to find out how long the party existed by the time the brigades ceased to exist in 2018. By 2018, the party had existed for 71 years (2018 - 1947 = 71 years).

However, to answer the question directly: The party existed for 65 years before the paramilitary wing was even formed"

","To find out how many years longer the Red Brigades were belligerents than the Workers' Autonomy, we need to compare the duration of their activities.

1. **Identify the years of activity for the Red Brigades**: According to the table, the Red Brigades were active from 1970 to 1988, which gives us a total of 18 years of activity.

2. **Identify the years of activity for the Workers' Autonomy**: The table states that the Workers' Autonomy was active from 1973 to 1979, which gives us a total of 6 years of activity.

3. **Calculate the difference in years**: To find out how many years longer the Red Brigades were active compared to the Workers' Autonomy, we subtract the number of years the Workers' Autonomy was active from the number of years the Red Brigades were active. So, 18 years (Red Brigades) - 6 years (Workers' Autonomy) = 12 years.

Therefore, the Red Brigades were belligerents for 12 years longer than the Workers' Autonomy.

","To find out how many years one must wait from the earliest they can serve to being eligible for special forces, we need to look at the information provided in the ""Personnel"" section of the table.

1. The earliest age at which one can serve in the military is 17 years.
2. The age at which one becomes eligible for special forces deployment is 19 years.

Now, we calculate the difference between these two ages to find out how many years one must wait:

19 years (eligible for special forces) - 17 years (earliest age to serve) = 2 years

Therefore, one must wait 2 years from the earliest they can serve to being eligible for special forces.

","To find out how many years older the highest military age is compared to the youngest in the Republic of Korea Armed Forces, we first need to identify the youngest and oldest military ages mentioned in the table.

1. **Identify the youngest military age**: The table mentions that the ""Military age"" is 18. This is the youngest age at which someone can be considered for military service.

2. **Identify the highest military age for conscription**: The table states that conscription is for those ""18-28 years of age"". Therefore, the highest age for conscription is 28.

3. **Calculate the difference**: To find out how many years older the highest military age for conscription is compared to the youngest, we subtract the youngest age from the oldest age. So, 28 (highest age) - 18 (youngest age) = 10 years.

Therefore, the highest military age for conscription is 10 years older than the youngest military age in the Republic of Korea Armed Forces.

2. **Understand the Context of Ba'athist Iraq**: The table mentions ""Ba'athist Iraq"" as the entity that came into power after 1968, following the Republic of Iraq. However, Ahmed Hassan al-Bakr's mention is specifically in 1963, which is before the Ba'athist Iraq period mentioned in the table.

3. **Determine the Leadership Period**: Since Ahmed Hassan al-Bakr is mentioned as a leader in 1963 and the question asks about his leadership of Ba'athist Iraq, we need to clarify that his leadership in 1963 was not of Ba'athist Iraq as defined by the post-1968 period but rather as part of the Republic of Iraq.

","To determine how many years Claire Leroy, Elodie Bertrand, and Riou will have to wait to try to win gold, we first need to establish the current year and the year of the event they participated in.

1. **Identify the year of the event**: The event mentioned is the 2011 ISAF Sailing World Championships.
2. **Assume the current year**: Since the problem doesn't specify the current year, we'll use the given ""Cutting Knowledge Date"" as a reference, which is December 2022.

","To find out how many years someone who is 8 years old would have to wait before serving in the Federal Defence Forces of Germany, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the minimum age for military service in the Federal Defence Forces of Germany.
2. Calculate the difference between the minimum age for service and the current age of the individual.

Step 1: According to the table, the ""Military age"" is 17. This means that an individual must be at least 17 years old to serve in the Federal Defence Forces of Germany.

Step 2: The individual in question is currently 8 years old. To find out how many years they have to wait before they can serve, we subtract their current age from the minimum age for service:
17 (minimum age) - 8 (current age) = 9 years

Therefore, someone who is 8 years old would have to wait 9 years before they can serve in the Federal Defence Forces of Germany.

","To find out how much longer Neptune's orbital period is compared to its synodic period, we need to subtract the synodic period from the orbital period.

1. First, identify the orbital period and the synodic period from the given information:
   - Orbital period = 60,195 days
   - Synodic period = 367.49 days

2. Next, subtract the synodic period from the orbital period:
   - Difference = Orbital period - Synodic period
   - Difference = 60,195 days - 367.49 days

3. Perform the subtraction:
   - Difference ≈ 59,827.51 days

4. Round the result to the nearest integer as requested:
   - Rounded difference ≈ 59,828 days

Therefore, Neptune's orbital period is approximately 59,828 days longer than its synodic period.

","To find out how much longer in days the time between the Western and Eastern dates in 2021 is than in 2023, let's calculate the difference for each year and then compare them.

1. **Calculate the difference for 2021:**
   - Western date in 2021: April 2
   - Eastern date in 2021: April 30
   - Difference in 2021 = April 30 - April 2 = 28 days

2. **Calculate the difference for 2023:**
   - Western date in 2023: April 7
   - Eastern date in 2023: April 14
   - Difference in 2023 = April 14 - April 7 = 7 days

3. **Find the difference between the two years' differences:**
   - Difference in 2021 - Difference in 2023 = 28 days - 7 days = 21 days

So, the time between the Western and Eastern dates in 2021 is 21 days longer than in 2023.

   - He played for Club Egara from 0000 to 2005 and then again from 2016 to 2021.
   - The first stint is 2005 years (assuming he started at a young age, the exact start year isn't provided, but we know he played until 2005).
   - The second stint is 5 years (2016-2021).
   - Total years at Club Egara = 2005 (or the number of years from his start until 2005, which we can't precisely calculate due to missing information) + 5 years.
   - However, given the information provided, we can only accurately account for the years from 2005 onwards.

","To determine how much longer the LIFEX refit was compared to the Major refit, we first need to establish the duration of each refit.

1. **Identify the duration of the Major refit**: The table states that the Major refit occurred from 2009 to 2010. This indicates the refit lasted for 1 year.

2. **Identify the duration of the LIFEX refit**: The table mentions that the LIFEX refit took place from 2015 to 2017. This means the LIFEX refit lasted for 2 years.

3. **Calculate the difference in duration**: To find out how much longer the LIFEX refit was compared to the Major refit, we subtract the duration of the Major refit from the duration of the LIFEX refit. So, 2 years (LIFEX refit) - 1 year (Major refit) = 1 year.

Therefore, the LIFEX refit was 1 year longer than the Major refit.

1. Identify the year Ali Farag reached the number one ranking.
2. Identify Ali Farag's birth year.
3. Calculate the age of Ali Farag in the year he reached the number one ranking.

Step 1: According to the table, Ali Farag's highest ranking and current ranking (as of June 2022) is No. 1. Therefore, the year he reached the number one ranking is 2022.

Step 2: Ali Farag was born on April 22, 1992.

Step 3: To calculate Ali Farag's age in 2022, subtract his birth year from the year he reached the number one ranking. 
2022 - 1992 = 30

Since Ali Farag reached the number one ranking in June 2022 and was born in April 1992, he would have been 30 years old when he reached the number one ranking.

","To find out how old Ali Farag was when he turned professional, we need to look at two key pieces of information from the table: his birthdate and the year he turned pro.

1. **Birthdate**: Ali Farag was born on 22 April 1992.
2. **Year Turned Pro**: He turned professional in 2009.

Now, let's calculate his age at the time he turned pro:

- Birth year: 1992
- Year turned pro: 2009

The difference between the year he turned pro and his birth year is 2009 - 1992 = 17 years.

Since his birthday is on April 22, and assuming he turned pro at some point in 2009 before his birthday, he would have been 16 years old when he turned pro. However, if he turned pro after April 22, 2009, he would have been 17 years old.

Given that the exact date of turning pro is not specified, we can conclude that Ali Farag was either 16 or 17 years old when he turned professional, depending on whether the event occurred before or after his 17th birthday in 2009.

Final Answer: Ali Farag was either 16 or 17"

","To find out how old Ali Farag was when he won his first team gold at the World Team Championships, we need to follow these steps:

1. Identify the year Ali Farag won his first team gold at the World Team Championships.
2. Determine Ali Farag's birth year.
3. Calculate the age of Ali Farag at the time of winning his first team gold.

Step 1: According to the table, Ali Farag's first team gold at the World Team Championships was in 2017 in Marseille.

Step 2: Ali Farag was born on 22 April 1992.

Step 3: To calculate his age in 2017, we subtract his birth year from the year he won the gold: 2017 - 1992 = 25. However, since his birthday is in April and the World Team Championships took place in the same year, we need to consider if the event occurred before or after his birthday. The World Team Championships in Marseille took place from November 27 to December 3, 2017, which is after his birthday in April. Therefore, by the time the championships occurred, he had already turned 25 years old.

Since we're looking for how old he was at the time of joining, we consider the earlier of the two debut dates, which is his ODI debut on 9 November 1990.

3. **Calculating Age**:
   - Born: 2 May 1969
   - Debut: 9 November 1990

From May 1969 to November 1990, Brian Lara would have been 21 years old, as he had not yet had his 22nd birthday (which would be in May 1991).

Therefore, when Brian Lara joined the West Indies international team, he was 21 years old.

","To determine how old Chris Ciriello was during the 2012 London Olympics, let's break down the information:

1. **Birthdate of Chris Ciriello**: He was born on October 1, 1985.
2. **Date of the 2012 London Olympics**: The 2012 London Olympics took place from July 27 to August 12, 2012.
3. **Calculating Age**: Since Chris Ciriello's birthday is on October 1, during the 2012 Olympics (which occurred in July and August), he would not have had his birthday yet that year.

Given that Chris Ciriello was born in 1985, we subtract his birth year from the year of the Olympics (2012) to get his age at the time of the Olympics, keeping in mind that his birthday had not yet occurred in 2012.

2012 - 1985 = 27

Therefore, Chris Ciriello was 26 years old during the 2012 London Olympics, as he had not yet turned 27.

* Up to date as of May 2007.

","To find out how old Daisuke Shiga (Tochiazuma Daisuke) was in the year of his professional debut, we need to follow these steps:

1. Identify the year of his professional debut.
2. Identify his birth year.
3. Calculate the age at the time of his debut.

From the table, we can see that:
- His debut was in November 1994.
- He was born on November 9, 1976.

Now, let's calculate his age at the time of his debut:
- Since he debuted in November 1994 and was born in November 1976, we subtract the birth year from the debut year to get the age: 1994 - 1976 = 18 years.

However, because his birthday is in November and his debut was also in November, we need to consider if he had his birthday before or after his debut in 1994. Given that the debut month and birth month are the same, and without the exact debut date, we can reasonably assume he was 18 years old at the time of his debut, as his 18th birthday would have occurred just before his debut, assuming his debut was later in November than his birthday.

","To find out how old Dhyan Chand was when he won his final gold medal at the 1936 Olympic Games, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Identify the year of the event**: The year Dhyan Chand won his final gold medal is 1936, at the Berlin Olympic Games.

2. **Identify Dhyan Chand's birth year**: According to the table, Dhyan Chand was born on 29 August 1905.

3. **Calculate the age**: To calculate Dhyan Chand's age at the time of winning his final gold medal, we subtract his birth year from the year of the event. 

   - Year of the event: 1936
   - Birth year: 1905
   - Age = 1936 - 1905 = 31 years

However, since his birthday is on August 29 and the 1936 Summer Olympics took place from August 1 to August 16, 1936, we need to consider if his birthday had passed before the Olympics concluded.

Given that the Olympics ended before his birthday in August, we should consider his age as of the time of the Olympics, which would still be 30 years old, as his 31st birthday had not yet occurred.

1. **Dhyan Chand's birthdate:** 29 August 1905
2. **Year of the first gold medal:** 1928
3. **Olympics event date:** The 1928 Amsterdam Olympics took place from May 17 to August 12, 1928. Since the exact date of the hockey final is not provided, we will assume the event concluded before August 29, 1928, for the purpose of calculating his age.

- In 1977, he would have been 26 years old.
- In 1978, he would have been 27 years old.
- In 1979, he would have been 28 years old.
- In 1980, he would have been 29 years old.

","To find out how old Futabayama Sadaji was when he made his debut, we need to follow these steps:

1. Identify the birth year and month of Futabayama Sadaji: He was born on February 9, 1912.
2. Identify the year and month of his debut: He debuted in March 1927.
3. Calculate the age at the time of debut: Subtract the birth year from the debut year to get the age in years, and consider the months to adjust if necessary.

2. **Identify Gino Bartali's birth year**: The table states that Gino Bartali was born on 18 July 1914.

3. **Calculate Gino Bartali's age when he joined his first professional team**: To find out how old he was, we subtract his birth year from the year he joined his first professional team. So, 1935 - 1914 = 21.

Therefore, Gino Bartali was 21 years old when he joined his first professional team, but since his birthday is in July and he joined the team presumably at the start of the cycling season (which could be before or after his birthday), we should consider if this calculation needs adjustment based on the exact timing of his team joining and birthday. However, given the information provided, the calculation gives us his age as of the end of 1934 or the beginning of 1935, before his 21st birthday if"

","To find out how old Jorge Lombi was when he won a Champions Challenge bronze medal, we need to follow these steps:

1. Identify the year Jorge Lombi won the Champions Challenge bronze medal.
2. Identify Jorge Lombi's birth year.
3. Calculate the difference between the year of the bronze medal win and Jorge Lombi's birth year to find his age at that time.

From the table, we can see that Jorge Lombi won the bronze medal in 2001 at the Champions Challenge in Kuala Lumpur. 

Jorge Lombi was born on November 1, 1971.

Now, we calculate his age in 2001:
2001 (year of the bronze medal) - 1971 (birth year) = 30 years.

Since the bronze medal was won in 2001 and considering his birthdate is in November, if the event occurred before November 1, 2001, he would have been 29 years old at the time of the win. If it occurred on or after November 1, 2001, he would have been 30 years old.

Given that we do not have the exact date of the Champions Challenge in 2001, we can conclude that Jorge Lombi was either 29 or 30"

   1995 - 1971 = 24

Since his birthday is on November 1 and the Pan American Games took place in 1995, we need to consider if the event occurred before or after his birthday in 1995. The 1995 Pan American Games took place from March 12 to March 26, 1995, in Mar del Plata. Given that the games happened before November 1, 1995, Jorge Lombi would have been 23 years old during the event.

","To find out how old Kimi Räikkönen was when he started competing in 2001, we need to calculate his age based on his birth year.

1. **Identify Kimi Räikkönen's birth year**: According to the table, Kimi Räikkönen was born on October 17, 1979.

2. **Calculate his age in 2001**: To find out how old he was when he started competing in 2001, we subtract his birth year from the year he started competing. However, since his birthday is in October, we need to consider if he had already had his birthday in 2001 when he started competing.

3. **Determine the age**: If Kimi Räikkönen started competing before October 17, 2001, he would have been 21 years old. If he started competing after October 17, 2001, he would have been 22 years old.

Given that his first entry was the 2001 Australian Grand Prix, which typically takes place in early March, it's before his October birthday. Therefore, when he started competing in 2001, Kimi Räikkönen was 21 years old.

","To find out how old Shaun Pollock was during his Test debut, we need to follow these steps:

1. Identify the date of Shaun Pollock's Test debut.
2. Identify Shaun Pollock's birthdate.
3. Calculate the age based on the difference between the debut date and the birthdate.

Step 1: According to the table, Shaun Pollock's Test debut was on ""16 November 1995 v England"".

Step 2: His birthdate is given as ""16 July 1973"".

Step 3: To calculate his age at the time of his Test debut, we subtract his birth year from the year of his debut and then consider the months and days.

- Birthdate: 16 July 1973
- Debut date: 16 November 1995

Since his debut month (November) is after his birth month (July) in the same year, we simply subtract the years: 1995 - 1973 = 22 years.

Given that November comes after July, and considering the days (16th in both cases), Shaun Pollock was 22 years old at the time of his Test debut.

","To find out how old Rubens Barrichello was when he won his last Grand Prix, we need to follow these steps:

1. Identify the date of his last Grand Prix win.
2. Identify his birth date.
3. Calculate the age based on these two dates.

From the table, we can find the following information:
- His last win was at the 2009 Italian Grand Prix.
- He was born on 23 May 1972.

Given that the last win was in 2009 and his birth year is 1972, we calculate his age at the time of his last win as follows:
- 2009 (year of the last win) - 1972 (birth year) = 37 years.

Therefore, when considering the month of his birth (May) and the timing of the Italian Grand Prix (which usually takes place in September), we can refine the calculation:
- Since his birthday (May 23) would have already passed by the time of the Italian Grand Prix in September, the calculated age of 37 is accurate for the event in question.

","To determine how old Räikkönen was when he began his Formula One career, let's break down the information provided.

1. **Räikkönen's birthdate**: He was born on October 17, 1979.
2. **Start of his Formula One career**: His first entry into the Formula One World Championship was the 2001 Australian Grand Prix.

Given that the exact date of the 2001 Australian Grand Prix is not provided in the table, we'll assume it took place in early 2001, as is typical for the Australian Grand Prix. 

Now, let's calculate his age at the start of his Formula One career:
- Räikkönen was born in 1979.
- He started his Formula One career in 2001.

So, in 2001, Räikkönen would have been 21 years old (since his birthday is in October, he would have turned 22 later in the year, but at the time of the Australian Grand Prix in early 2001, he was still 21).

3. Calculate the age by subtracting the birth year from the year he joined Mumbai.

From the table provided, under ""Domestic team information,"" it is stated that Sachin Tendulkar played for Mumbai from 1988-2013. Therefore, the year he joined team Mumbai is 1988.

Sachin Tendulkar's birthdate is given as 24 April 1973.

Now, to find out how old he was when he joined Mumbai in 1988, we subtract his birth year from the year he joined:

1988 - 1973 = 15

So, Sachin Tendulkar was 15 years old when he joined team Mumbai, considering that he joined at the beginning of 1988 and his birthday is in April.

","To find out how old Shaun Pollock was when he made his ODI debut in 1996, we need to follow these steps:

1. Identify Shaun Pollock's birthdate: According to the table, Shaun Pollock was born on 16 July 1973.

2. Identify the date of his ODI debut: The table states that his ODI debut was on 9 January 1996.

3. Calculate his age at the time of his ODI debut: To do this, we subtract his birth year from the year of his debut and then consider the months and days.

- Shaun Pollock was born in 1973, so as of 1996, he would be 22 years old (1996 - 1973 = 23), but since his birthday is in July and his debut was in January, he hadn't had his birthday in 1996 yet.

Therefore, when Shaun Pollock made his ODI debut on 9 January 1996, he was 22 years old.

","To determine after what date Hurricane Gaston was on land, we need to look at the information provided about when it formed, dissipated, and specifically when it moved ashore.

1. **Formation Date**: Hurricane Gaston formed on August 27, 2004. This is the date it began as a cyclone, but it doesn't tell us when it made landfall.

2. **Dissipation Date**: It dissipated on September 3, 2004. This gives us a timeframe but still doesn't specify when it moved ashore.

3. **Landfall Information**: The key piece of information is the caption that includes a photo description: ""Hurricane Gaston shortly after moving ashore on August 29."" This directly tells us when Gaston made landfall.

Given this information, Hurricane Gaston was on land after August 29, 2004, because that's the date it moved ashore.

","To determine which year Purim occurs the earliest in the year between 2021 and 2024, we need to compare the dates of Purim for each of these years.

1. **2021 date**: Sunset, 25 February - nightfall, 26 February
2. **2022 date**: Sunset, 16 March - nightfall, 17 March
3. **2023 date**: Sunset, 6 March - nightfall, 7 March
4. **2024 date**: Sunset, 23 March - nightfall, 24 March

Comparing these dates:
- 25 February is earlier than 16 March, 6 March, and 23 March.
- However, 6 March is earlier than 16 March and 23 March but later than 25 February.

Therefore, the year when Purim occurs the earliest in the year between 2021 and 2024 is **2021**, as it starts on February 25, which is before the start dates of Purim in the subsequent years.

   - The date of Black Friday in 2022 was November 25.

2. **Calculate the difference**:

1. **Identify the year Dhanraj Pillay joined the National team:** According to the table under ""National team"", Dhanraj Pillay played for India from 1989 to 2004.

2. **Identify Dhanraj Pillay's birth year:** The table under ""Personal information"" states that Dhanraj Pillay was born on July 16, 1968.

3. **Calculate the age at which he joined the National team:** Since he joined the National team in 1989, we subtract his birth year from the year he joined to find his age at that time. However, because we are calculating age, we should consider the month of birth as well for precision. Dhanraj Pillay was born in July 1968 and joined the team in 1989. 

   - If he joined the team before July 1989, he would have been 20 years old.
   - If he joined the team in July 1989 or after, he would have been 21 years old by the time the year ended.

","To answer this question, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Identify the year when the annual exports totaled around $2 billion**: According to the table under the ""Industry"" section, the annual exports were around A$2 billion in 2018.

2. **Identify the year when the active personnel were 59,095**: Under the ""Personnel"" section, it's stated that there were 59,095 active personnel as of 30 June 2020.

","To find the age at which Chiyonofuji Mitsugu retired, we need to determine his birth year and the year he retired, then calculate the difference.

1. **Birth Year and Retirement Year**: Chiyonofuji Mitsugu was born on June 1, 1955, and he retired in May 1991.

2. **Calculate Age at Retirement**: To find his age at retirement, we subtract his birth year from his retirement year and then consider the months. Since he was born in June and retired in May, we need to subtract 1 from the result of the year subtraction because he hadn't had his birthday in the year he retired.

   - Year of retirement: 1991
   - Year of birth: 1955
   - Age at retirement = 1991 - 1955 = 36 years

However, considering the months (June for birth and May for retirement), he was still 35 years old when he retired because his 36th birthday would have been after his retirement.

Therefore, Chiyonofuji Mitsugu retired at the age of 35.

","To answer the question of when the Maori was completed, we need to look at the information provided in the table under the ""History"" section. The relevant information is listed under the headings ""Completed"" and ""Commissioned"". 

1. **Completed**: This refers to the date when the ship's construction was finished, and it was ready for service in terms of its physical build and equipment installation.
2. **Commissioned**: This is the date when the ship was officially put into service or commissioned into the navy. It's an administrative step that marks the ship's readiness for active duty.

Given the question asks for when the Maori was ""Underway completed,"" it seems to be asking for the completion date in terms of its construction being finished, which directly precedes it being put into active service.

According to the table, the Maori was:
- Completed: 30 November 1938
- Commissioned: 5 December 1938

Therefore, the date the Maori was completed, which is what ""Underway completed"" seems to be asking for, is 30 November 1938.

1. **First system formed:** June 2, 1995
2. **Last system dissipated:** November 1, 1995

Now, let's calculate the difference:

- July has 31 days.
- August has 31 days.
- September has 30 days.
- October has 31 days.
- For November, we only consider up to November 1, which is 1 day.

Adding these together: 28 (June) + 31 (July) + 31 (August) + 30 (September) + 31 (October) + 1 (November) = 152 days.

","To find out at what age Kimi Räikkönen got divorced, we need to follow these steps:

1. Identify the year Kimi Räikkönen got divorced. According to the table, he was divorced in 2014 from Jenni Dahlman.
2. Identify Kimi Räikkönen's birth year to calculate his age at the time of divorce. The table states he was born on October 17, 1979.
3. Calculate Kimi Räikkönen's age at the time of divorce. Since he was born in 1979 and got divorced in 2014, we subtract the birth year from the divorce year to get his age at the end of that year, but considering he was divorced and his birthday is in October, we need to see if he had his birthday before or after the divorce to accurately determine his age at the time of divorce.

Given that the exact date of divorce is not specified, but assuming it happened before his birthday in October (since the table does not provide a specific date for the divorce), Kimi Räikkönen would have been 34 years old at the time of his divorce in 2014, because he would not have had his 35th birthday yet"

","To find out at what age Mohamed El Shorbagy turned pro, we need to look at two key pieces of information from the table: his birthdate and the year he turned pro.

1. **Birthdate**: Mohamed El Shorbagy was born on January 12, 1991.
2. **Year Turned Pro**: He turned pro in 2006.

Now, let's calculate his age at the time he turned pro:

- Birth year: 1991
- Year turned pro: 2006

The difference between the year he turned pro and his birth year is 2006 - 1991 = 15 years.

Therefore, Mohamed El Shorbagy was 15 years old when he turned pro.

1. The formation date of Hurricane Gaston is given as August 27, 2004.
2. The dissipation date of Hurricane Gaston is given as September 3, 2004.

Given these dates, we can see that Hurricane Gaston formed in August 2004 and dissipated in September 2004. 

Since the hurricane existed in two distinct months (August and September), we can conclude that it existed over 2 months, even though the period of existence within these months was relatively short.

","To find out at what age Don Bradman joined his second domestic team, we first need to identify his second domestic team and the year he joined it. According to the table, his domestic teams were:

1. New South Wales (1927/28-1933/34)
2. South Australia (1935/36-1948/49)

So, his second domestic team was South Australia, which he joined in the 1935/36 season.

Next, we need to determine Don Bradman's age at that time. He was born on 27 August 1908. 

When he joined South Australia in 1935, we calculate his age as follows:
- If he joined at the beginning of the 1935/36 season (assuming around August or September 1935), he would have been 27 years old, since his birthday (27 August) would have already passed in 1935.

Therefore, Don Bradman joined his second domestic team, South Australia, at the age of 27.

1. **Identify the date of Don Bradman's last Test**: According to the table, his last Test was on 18 August 1948.

2. **Identify Don Bradman's birthdate**: The table states that Don Bradman was born on 27 August 1908.

3. **Calculate the age at the time of the last Test**: To find the age, we subtract the birth year from the year of the last Test and then consider the months and days for a precise calculation.

- Year of last Test: 1948
- Year of birth: 1908
- Difference in years: 1948 - 1908 = 40 years

Since Don Bradman's birthday (27 August) is after the date of his last Test (18 August) in the same year (1948), he had not yet had his 40th birthday when he played his last Test. Therefore, at the time of his last Test, Don Bradman was 39 years old.

1. **Identify the years Eddy Merckx won the Tour de France**: According to the table, Merckx won the Tour de France in 1969, 1970, 1971, 1972, and 1974.

2. **Identify the years he won individual stages**: The table mentions that he won 34 individual stages between 1969 and 1975.

3. **Determine the age at which he last won individual stages**: Since the question asks for the age at which he last won 34 individual stages, we need to find out the year of his last win and then calculate his age at that time.

Given that his last win among the mentioned years was in 1975 (considering the range 1969-1975 for individual stages), we calculate his age as follows:

- Eddy Merckx was born on June 17, 1945.
- His last win was in 1975.

1. **Identify the dates**: 
   - Black Friday in 2022 is on November 25.
   - Black Friday in 2024 is on November 29.

2. **Calculate the difference**:
   - To find the difference in days, we calculate the number of days between November 25, 2022, and November 29, 2024.
   - First, calculate the difference in days between November 25, 2022, and November 25, 2024, which is exactly 2 years.
   - Since 2022 and 2024 are both leap years (though the leap day, February 29, does not affect our November dates), the number of days in 2 years is 365 * 2 = 730 days.
   - Then, we need to account for the additional 4 days from November 25 to November 29 in 2024.
   - So, the total difference is 730 days + 4 days = 734 days.

","To find the difference in the synodic period between Mars and Earth, we first need to understand what a synodic period is. The synodic period of a planet is the time it takes for the planet to return to the same position in the sky relative to the Sun, as observed from Earth. This is essentially the time between two successive oppositions (when the planet is on the opposite side of the Earth from the Sun).

1. **Find the Synodic Period of Mars**: The synodic period of Mars is given in the table as 779.96 days. To convert this into years, we divide by 365.25 (the average number of days in a year, accounting for leap years).

   Synodic period of Mars in years = 779.96 days / 365.25 days/year ≈ 2.1354 years (as also directly provided in the table).

2. **Find the Synodic Period of Earth**: Since we're observing from Earth, Earth's synodic period is essentially the time it takes for the Earth to orbit the Sun once, which is 1 year. The synodic period is a concept that applies to other planets as seen from Earth, so for Earth itself, we simply consider its orbital period around the Sun,"

","To find the minimum conscription length of the Israel Defense Forces in years, we need to look at the information provided in the table under the ""Personnel"" section. The relevant information is:

- Conscription: 24-34 months

Since we are asked for the minimum conscription length in years, we need to convert the minimum period from months to years. 

1. The minimum conscription period is 24 months.
2. To convert months to years, we divide by 12 (since there are 12 months in a year).
3. So, 24 months / 12 = 2 years.

Therefore, the minimum conscription length of the Israel Defense Forces is 2 years.

","To determine around which year the next orbital period of Neptune will begin, starting from the time of perihelion, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Identify the Time of Perihelion**: The table provides the time of perihelion as 2042-Sep-04. This is the starting point for our calculation.

2. **Determine the Orbital Period**: The orbital period of Neptune, as given in the table, is 164.8 years. This is the time it takes for Neptune to complete one orbit around the Sun.

3. **Calculate the Next Orbital Period Start**: To find out when the next orbital period will begin, we need to add the orbital period to the time of perihelion. Since the time of perihelion is given as 2042, we add 164.8 years to this date.

4. **Perform the Calculation**: 
   - Start year: 2042
   - Orbital period: 164.8 years
   - Next perihelion year ≈ 2042 + 164.8 ≈ 2206.8

Given that the orbital period is approximately 164.8 years and the next perihelion after 2042"

","To find out at what age Ali Farag turned professional, we need to look at two pieces of information from the table: his birthdate and the year he turned pro.

1. **Birthdate**: Ali Farag was born on April 22, 1992.
2. **Year Turned Pro**: He turned professional in 2009.

Now, let's calculate his age at the time he turned pro:

","To find the age at which Gagan Ajit Singh won a medal at the Asian Games, we first need to identify the year he won the medal and then calculate his age at that time based on his birth year.

1. **Identify the year Gagan Ajit Singh won a medal at the Asian Games**: According to the table, Gagan Ajit Singh won a Silver medal at the 2002 Busan Asian Games.

2. **Calculate his age at the time of winning the medal**: Gagan Ajit Singh was born on December 9, 1980. The Asian Games where he won the medal took place in 2002.

3. **Compute the age**: To find his age in 2002, we subtract his birth year from the year of the event: 2002 - 1980 = 22 years. However, since his birthday is in December, and the Asian Games took place before his birthday in 2002 (assuming the games happened earlier in the year), we consider him to be 21 years old at the time of the event.
