","To find out how many months after being apprehended Jeffrey Epstein died by suicide, we need to calculate the time difference between his apprehension and his death.

1. **Date of Apprehension**: Jeffrey Epstein was apprehended on July 6, 2019.
2. **Date of Death**: He died on August 10, 2019.

Now, let's calculate the time difference:

- July has 31 days, so from July 6 to July 31, there are 25 days.
- August 10 is 10 days into August.

Therefore, the total number of days from July 6 to August 10 is 25 (remaining days in July) + 10 (days in August up to the 10th) = 35 days.

Since we're asked for the approximate number of months, we need to convert these days into months. Given that a month is approximately 30 days, we can estimate:

35 days / 30 days per month ≈ 1.17 months

Rounding to the nearest whole number for an approximation, Jeffrey Epstein died approximately 1 month after being apprehended.

","To determine around what year Chandrayaan-2's orbiter's planned mission duration would end, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Identify the launch date**: The launch date of Chandrayaan-2 is given as 22 July 2019.
2. **Identify the planned mission duration of the orbiter**: The planned mission duration of the orbiter is stated as approximately 7.5 years.
3. **Calculate the end year of the mission**: To find the year when the planned mission duration would end, we add the planned mission duration to the launch year.

Given:
- Launch year: 2019
- Planned mission duration: 7.5 years

Calculation:
- End year = Launch year + Planned mission duration
- End year = 2019 + 7.5 years

Since 7.5 years would include half of a year, we can estimate the end year by adding 7 years to 2019 and then considering the additional half year.

- 2019 + 7 years = 2026
- Adding half a year to 2026 would bring us to the end of 2026.

Therefore, the planned mission duration of Chandrayaan-2's orbiter would end"

","To find the age at which Albert A. Michelson died, we need to calculate the difference between his year of death and his year of birth.

1. **Identify the birth and death dates**: 
   - Birth date: December 19, 1852
   - Death date: May 9, 1931

2. **Calculate the age at death**:
   - Year of birth: 1852
   - Year of death: 1931
   - Age at death = Year of death - Year of birth = 1931 - 1852 = 79

However, since his birthday (December 19) had not occurred yet in the year of his death (May 9), we need to consider if this affects his age calculation.

3. **Consider the months**:
   - He died in May before his December birthday, meaning he was still 78 years old at the time of his death.

Thus, by calculating the difference in years and considering the timing of his birth and death within those years, we can accurately determine Albert A. Michelson's age at the time of his death.

","To determine at what age Paul Gauguin separated from Mette-Sophie Gad, let's break down the information provided:

1. **Birth Date of Paul Gauguin**: He was born on June 7, 1848.
2. **Separation Year from Mette-Sophie Gad**: The couple separated in 1894.
3. **Calculation of Age at Separation**: To find out how old Paul Gauguin was when he separated from Mette-Sophie Gad, we subtract his birth year from the year of separation and then consider the months.

Given that his birthdate is June 7, 1848, and the separation occurred in 1894, we calculate his age as follows:

- Year of separation: 1894
- Birth year: 1848
- Age at separation (in years): 1894 - 1848 = 46 years

Since the separation happened in 1894 and his birthday is in June, if the separation occurred before June 7, 1894, he would have been 45 years old at the time of separation. If it happened after June 7, 1894, he would have been 46 years old.

3. Calculate the age of Paul Gauguin at the time of separation. We know Paul Gauguin was born on June 7, 1848. Therefore, to find his age in 1893, we subtract his birth year from the year of separation: 1893 - 1848 = 45 years.
4. Since we are calculating his age at the time of separation in 1893 and considering his birthdate is in June, if the separation occurred before June 7, 1893, he would have been 44 years old. If it occurred on or after June 7, 1893, he would have been 45 years old.

1. **Identify the divorce year**: According to the table, Stephen Hawking married Jane Wilde in 1965 and divorced her in 1995.

2. **Calculate Stephen Hawking's age at divorce**: 
   - Stephen Hawking was born on January 8, 1942.
   - He divorced Jane Wilde in 1995.
   - To find his age in 1995, we subtract his birth year from the divorce year: 1995 - 1942 = 53 years.

Since his birthday is on January 8, and assuming the divorce occurred after his birthday in 1995 (without the exact date of divorce), we can conclude that Stephen Hawking was 53 years old when he divorced Jane Wilde.

2. **Calculate Stephen Hawking's age at the time of divorce**: We know Stephen Hawking was born on January 8, 1942. To find his age at the time of divorce in 1995, we subtract his birth year from the year of divorce and then consider the month of birth and divorce to accurately determine his age.

   - Year of divorce: 1995
   - Year of birth: 1942
   - Age at divorce = 1995 - 1942 = 53 years

   Since Stephen Hawking's birthday is in January and the divorce occurred in the same year, without a specific date of divorce, we can conclude he was 53 years old when he divorced, considering his birthday would have already passed in January before the divorce in 1995.

Therefore, Stephen Hawking was 53 years old when he divorced his first wife, Jane Wilde.

","To find the age at which Steve Jobs ended his partnership with Chrisann Brennan, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the year the partnership with Chrisann Brennan ended.
2. Determine Steve Jobs' birth year.
3. Calculate Steve Jobs' age at the end of the partnership.

Step 1: The table states that Steve Jobs' partnership with Chrisann Brennan was from 1972 to 1977. Therefore, the partnership ended in 1977.

Step 2: Steve Jobs was born in 1955, as indicated by his birthdate, February 24, 1955.

Step 3: To calculate Steve Jobs' age at the end of the partnership, we subtract his birth year from the year the partnership ended and then consider his birth month to accurately determine his age. Since the partnership ended in 1977 and Steve Jobs was born in 1955, the basic calculation is 1977 - 1955 = 22 years. However, because Steve Jobs' birthday is in February and the partnership ended presumably at the end of the year (since the exact date of the end of the partnership is not provided), we should consider if he had already had his birthday in 1977.

1. **Identify Steve Jobs' birthdate**: According to the table, Steve Jobs was born on February 24, 1955.
2. **Identify the period he was with his first partner**: The table mentions Chrisann Brennan as a partner from 1972 to 1977.
3. **Calculate Steve Jobs' age when he first had a partner**: Since Steve Jobs was born in 1955 and his partnership with Chrisann Brennan started in 1972, we subtract his birth year from the start year of the partnership to find his age. However, because his birthday is in February, and the partnership started in 1972, we need to consider if the partnership began before or after his birthday in 1972 to accurately determine his age at the start of the partnership.

Given that Steve Jobs was born in 1955, in 1972, he would have been 17 years old. This calculation does not require further adjustment because, regardless of the exact date in 1972 when the partnership started, Steve Jobs would have still been 17 years old, as his 18th birthday"

","To determine at what age Tony Stewart was inducted into the NASCAR Hall of Fame, we first need to identify the year he was inducted and his birth year.

1. **Identify the year Tony Stewart was inducted into the NASCAR Hall of Fame:** According to the table, Tony Stewart was inducted into the NASCAR Hall of Fame in 2020.

2. **Identify Tony Stewart's birth year:** The table states that Tony Stewart was born on May 20, 1971.

3. **Calculate Tony Stewart's age at the time of induction:** To find out how old Tony Stewart was when he was inducted into the NASCAR Hall of Fame, we subtract his birth year from the year of induction.
   
   Year of induction: 2020
   Birth year: 1971
   
   Age at induction = 2020 - 1971 = 49 years old.

Therefore, Tony Stewart was 49 years old when he was inducted into the NASCAR Hall of Fame.

['~400,000-579,000 killed | ~1,200,000 deaths from famine']

","To answer this question, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Identify the relevant information**: We need to find the years when Russia's (or Soviet Union's, as it was known at the time) support ended and Israel's support began for the sides involved in the Ethiopian Civil War.

2. **Locate Russia/Soviet Union's support details**: According to the table, the Soviet Union supported the Derg (and later the People's Democratic Republic of Ethiopia) from 1977 to 1990. This means Russia's (Soviet Union's) support ended in 1990.

3. **Locate Israel's support details**: The table states that Israel supported the Derg (or the government side) from 1990. This indicates that Israel's support began in 1990.

4. **Determine the year both events occurred**: Since both the end of Soviet support and the beginning of Israeli support are mentioned to have occurred in the same year, we can conclude that this year is 1990.

Lead position ends	16 October 2023
Jurist term ends	6 October 2024

","To find out for approximately how many more years Esther Hayut has been with the Supreme Court of Israel compared to Uzi Vogelman, we first need to determine how long each has been in their current role or associated with the court.

1. **Esther Hayut's Tenure**: Esther Hayut has been the President of the Supreme Court of Israel since 26 October 2017. As of December 2022, she has been in this position for approximately 5 years.

2. **Uzi Vogelman's Tenure**: Uzi Vogelman became the Deputy President on 9 May 2022. As of December 2022, he has been in this role for approximately 7 months, or less than 1 year.

Given this information, we calculate the difference in their tenures:
- Esther Hayut has been with the Supreme Court in her role for about 5 years.
- Uzi Vogelman has been in his role for less than 1 year.

Thus, the difference in their tenure lengths is approximately 5 years - 0.5 years (considering 7 months as roughly half a year for simplicity) = 4.5 years.

1. The ""Playing career"" line in the ""Career information"" section gives us the years of Abdul Jeelani's playing career, which are 1976-1989.
2. This range gives us the total duration of his professional basketball career.
3. To find out how many years he played, we subtract the starting year from the ending year and then add 1 (since both the starting and ending years are inclusive).

Starting year: 1976
Ending year: 1989

Number of years = Ending year - Starting year + 1
= 1989 - 1976 + 1
= 13 + 1
= 14

However, considering that the calculation includes the year he was drafted and possibly started playing, and given that the ending year marks the conclusion of his career, the straightforward subtraction provides the correct number of years without needing to add 1 in this context, as the years are already counted inclusively in the range provided.

Therefore, Abdul Jeelani played professional basketball for 13 years.

Key dates

8 June 1953	Renamed | Black Dog Halt
20 September 1965	Closed

","To find out for how many years Black Dog Siding operated under its original name, we need to look at the key dates provided in the table.

1. The original opening date as Black Dog Siding is given as 3 November 1863.
2. The date it was renamed to Black Dog Halt is given as 8 June 1953.

The difference between these two dates will give us the number of years it operated under its original name.

Calculating the difference:
1953 - 1863 = 90 years

However, since the renaming occurred on June 8, 1953, and the opening was on November 3, 1863, we need to consider if this is a full 90 years or not, given the months. But for the purpose of calculating years, the specific months are often not considered unless the question specifically asks for the calculation in months or days.

Therefore, Black Dog Siding operated under its original name for approximately 90 years.

   - Libya supported the Eritrean separatists (and possibly other anti-Derg factions) from 1977 to 1985. This period is 8 years.
   - Then, Libya supported the Derg (and later the PDR Ethiopia) from 1985 to 1991. This period is 6 years.

3. **Determine the total duration of Libya's involvement**: Since the question asks for the total number of years Libya supported the Ethiopian Civil War, we add the years of support for both sides. However, the question does not specify whether we should consider the support for one side or the other as ""support for the war."" Given the context,"

1. **Identify the start year of production in Pakistan**: According to the table, the JF-17 Thunder started being produced in Pakistan in January 2008.

2. **Identify the current year**: Since we are considering the information up to December 2022, we take 2022 as the current year for our calculation.

3. **Calculate the number of years**: To find out how many years the JF-17 Thunder has been produced in Pakistan, we subtract the start year of production from the current year.
   
   - Start year of production in Pakistan: 2008
   - Current year: 2022
   - Number of years = Current year - Start year of production = 2022 - 2008 = 14 years

Therefore, the JF-17 Thunder has been produced in Pakistan for 14 years as of 2022.

","To find out how long Ingenuity flew on Mars in terms of days, we first need to understand the information given about its flights.

1. **First Flight Date**: Ingenuity's first flight was on 19 April 2021.
2. **Last Flight Date**: Its last flight was on 11 June 2022.
3. **Total Flight Time**: The total flight time is given as 55 minutes and 23 seconds.
4. **Number of Flights**: Ingenuity conducted 29 flights.

However, the question asks for the duration of Ingenuity's operational period on Mars in days, not the total flight time. Therefore, we need to calculate the number of days between the first and last flights.

- **First Flight**: 19 April 2021
- **Last Flight**: 11 June 2022

To find the number of days between these two dates:
- April has 30 days, so from 19 April to 30 April is 11 days.
- May has 31 days.
- June has 30 days, and the last flight was on 11 June.

So, for 2021: 11 days (April) + 31 days (May) + 30 days (June) = 72"

","To find out how long it took for Ingenuity to go from deployment to its first flight, we need to calculate the time difference between these two events.

1. **Deployment Date**: Ingenuity was deployed on 3 April 2021.
2. **First Flight Date**: Its first flight was on 19 April 2021.

Now, let's calculate the time difference:
- The deployment occurred on April 3, 2021.
- The first flight occurred on April 19, 2021.

Since both events happened within the same month (April 2021), we can directly calculate the difference in days:
- April 19 - April 3 = 16 days.

To convert days into months, we consider that a month is approximately 30 days. However, for precision in this context, we'll keep the calculation straightforward and recognize that the question essentially asks for the duration in a simplified manner.

Given that the entire period from deployment to the first flight falls within a single month (April), the duration in months can be considered as less than a full month. However, since the question seems to imply a need for a numerical answer and considering standard approximations might not perfectly apply here due to the phrasing of the question, the most straightforward interpretation"

The table states: ""Highest	1 (March 2007, October 2007 - June 2008, July-October 2015, April 2016 - April 2017)"". 

From this information, we can identify the following periods when Argentina was ranked number one:
1. March 2007 (just one month)
2. October 2007 - June 2008 (approximately 9 months, since it includes the end of 2007 and the beginning of 2008 up to June)
3. July-October 2015 (4 months)
4. April 2016 - April 2017 (12 months, since it covers a full year from April to April)

Given these periods, the longest time Argentina's Men's football team was ranked number one is 12 months, which occurred from April 2016 to April 2017.

","To find out how long in months it was between the day of Ingenuity's first flight and its last flight, we need to calculate the time difference between these two dates.

1. **Identify the dates**: The first flight of Ingenuity was on 19 April 2021, and the last flight was on 11 June 2022.

2. **Calculate the time difference**:
   - From April 19, 2021, to April 19, 2022, is exactly 1 year.
   - From April 19, 2022, to June 11, 2022, is approximately 1 month and 23 days.

3. **Convert to months**: 
   - 1 year is equal to 12 months.
   - The additional time from April 19 to June 11 is roughly 1.5 to 2 months, considering the approximation of the days to months.

4. **Add the months together**: 
   - Total months = 12 months (for the year) + approximately 1.5 to 2 months (for the additional period) = 13.5 to 14 months.

","To find out how long Casey Mears' career lasted in the Champ Car series, we need to look at the information provided about his career in that series.

1. **First Race in Champ Car Series**: The table mentions that Casey Mears' first race in the Champ Car series was in 2000, specifically at the Marlboro 500 in California.
2. **Last Race in Champ Car Series**: It also mentions that his last race in the Champ Car series was in 2001, again at the Marlboro 500 in California.
3. **Calculating Duration**: To find the duration of his career in the Champ Car series, we subtract the year of his first race from the year of his last race.

Given:
- First race year: 2000
- Last race year: 2001

Duration = Last race year - First race year = 2001 - 2000 = 1 year

Therefore, Casey Mears' career in the Champ Car series lasted for 1 year, from 2000 to 2001, but since it spanned parts of two years (the end of 2000 and the beginning of 2001), it's considered to be over 2 years in terms of the seasons he participated"

House	Obrenović
Father	Teodor Mihailović
Mother	Višnja Urošević
Religion	Serbian Orthodox

","To answer the question, we need to identify the period of Miloš Obrenović I's reign where Karađorđe was his predecessor, not successor, since the question seems to contain a mistake in the terminology used. Given the information:

1. Miloš Obrenović I was the Grand Vožd of Serbia from 23 April 1815 to 6 November 1817.
2. During this period, Karađorđe was indeed his predecessor as the Grand Vožd of Serbia.

Now, to calculate the duration of Miloš Obrenović I's reign as Grand Vožd:

- Start date: 23 April 1815
- End date: 6 November 1817

Calculating the difference:
- 1817 - 1815 = 2 years
- Additionally, from April to November is approximately 7 months.

So, the total duration is about 2 years and 7 months. However, since the question asks for the duration in years and given the nature of the provided answer choices (which are not shown but implied to be in years), we would typically round this to the nearest whole number if necessary, but in this context, understanding the question asks for a calculation based on"

2. **Dissolution Date**: The union effectively ended with the election of Gustav Vasa as King of Sweden in 1523, marking the beginning of a separate Swedish state. However, for the purpose of calculating the duration, we consider the year the union ceased to exist as a unified entity, which is 1537, when Denmark-Norway was established.

Now, let's calculate the duration:
- **Start Year**: 1397
- **End Year**: 1537

**Duration** = End Year - Start Year = 1537 - 1397 = 140 years

Therefore, the Kalmar Union lasted for 140 years.

","To find out how long AT&T had been known by a different name, we need to look at the ""Formerly"" section in the table. According to this section, AT&T was formerly known as Southwestern Bell Corporation from 1983 to 1995 and then as SBC Communications Inc. from 1995 to 2005.

Step 1: Calculate the duration of the name ""Southwestern Bell Corporation"".
- It was known by this name from 1983 to 1995, which is 1995 - 1983 = 12 years.

Step 2: Calculate the duration of the name ""SBC Communications Inc."".
- It was known by this name from 1995 to 2005, which is 2005 - 1995 = 10 years.

Step 3: Add the durations of both names to find the total duration AT&T was known by a different name.
- Total duration = 12 years + 10 years = 22 years.

Therefore, AT&T had been known by a different name for a total of 22 years.

","To determine how long the Salvadoran Civil War had been going on when North Korea withdrew its support, we need to follow these steps:

1. Identify the start date of the Salvadoran Civil War.
2. Identify the year North Korea withdrew its support.
3. Calculate the difference between these two dates to find out how long the war had been going on.

From the table, we can find the following information:
- The Salvadoran Civil War started on 15 October 1979.
- North Korea withdrew its support in 1990.

Now, let's calculate the duration:
- The war started in 1979.
- North Korea withdrew its support in 1990.

The difference between 1990 and 1979 is 11 years.

Therefore, when North Korea withdrew its support in 1990, the Salvadoran Civil War had been going on for 11 years.

","To find out how long the church has been open in total, we need to consider the periods it was open and subtract the periods it was closed from the total time elapsed since its construction or founding.

1. **Construction and Initial Opening**: The church was completed in 1707. 

2. **Closure Period**: It was closed from 1873 to 1949. This means it was closed for 76 years (1949 - 1873 = 76 years).

3. **Total Time Elapsed Since Construction**: From 1707 to 2022 (considering the current year as 2022 for calculation purposes), the church has been in existence for 315 years (2022 - 1707 = 315 years).

4. **Calculating Total Open Time**: To find out how long the church has been open, we subtract the closure period from the total time elapsed since its construction.
   
   Total open time = Total time elapsed since construction - Closure period
                   = 315 years - 76 years
                   = 239 years

","To determine how long the current AT&T logo has been in use, we need to consider the history of the company and any logo changes that may have occurred. However, the provided table does not directly mention the introduction of the current AT&T logo.

1. **Identify the Founding and Name Changes**: AT&T Inc. was formerly known as Southwestern Bell Corporation (from 1983 to 1995) and then SBC Communications Inc. (from 1995 to 2005). It became AT&T Inc. in 2005 after SBC Communications Inc. acquired the original AT&T Corporation.

2. **Consider Logo Changes with Name Changes**: Typically, a company's logo changes when it undergoes a significant rebranding, such as a name change. Given that the company changed its name to AT&T Inc. in 2005, it's plausible that the current logo was introduced around this time.

3. **Research on AT&T Logo History**: Without specific information on logo changes in the table, we rely on general knowledge. The current AT&T logo, often referred to as the ""globe"" logo, has been in use since 2005, following the acquisition of AT&T Corporation by SBC Communications Inc.

","To find out how long Arnold Schwarzenegger was the governor of California, we need to look at the ""In office"" dates provided in the table for his governorship.

1. The start date of his governorship is given as November 17, 2003.
2. The end date of his governorship is given as January 3, 2011.

Now, let's calculate the duration:

- He started his governorship in 2003 and ended it in 2011.
- The difference between 2011 and 2003 is 8 years.

However, since he didn't complete the full year of 2003 (starting in November) and also didn't serve the full year of 2011 (ending in January), we need to consider if this affects the total number of years.

Given that he served from November 2003 to January 2011, this period includes 8 full years (2004 through 2010) and parts of two years (the end of 2003 and the beginning of 2011).

Thus, the calculation of the full years served as governor is accurate as 8 years, considering the partial years at the beginning and end do not add up to a full additional year.

1. **Identify the Years of Service**: The table mentions that José Manuel de Herrera served as Emperor from 1822-1823. However, the question asks about his tenure as Prime Minister, not Emperor. Unfortunately, the table does not provide specific years for José Manuel de Herrera's service as Prime Minister. It only lists him under the ""Emperor"" section for the years 1822-1823 and does not give any information about a Prime Minister serving during those years or any other years.

2. **Clarify the Position**: Given the information, there seems to be a confusion or a lack of detail regarding José Manuel de Herrera's role as Prime Minister. The table does not specify any Prime Minister's tenure, suggesting either an omission or that the position might not have been clearly defined or filled during the mentioned period.

3. **Conclusion Based on Available Data**: Since the table does not provide specific information about José Manuel de Herrera serving as Prime Minister or the duration of such service, we cannot accurately determine how long he was Prime Minister of the Mexican Empire based on the given data.

","To determine how long Richard Caswell was married to his wives, we need to examine the information provided about his marriages.

1. Richard Caswell's first marriage was to Mary Mackilwean in 1752, and she died in 1757. So, he was married to Mary for 5 years.

2. After Mary's death, Richard Caswell married Sarah Herritage in 1758. The table does not specify the year Sarah died or if they divorced, but it does mention Richard Caswell's death in 1789. Therefore, we can calculate the duration of his second marriage from 1758 until his death in 1789, which would be approximately 31 years.

Since the question asks for the duration of his marriage (implying to one wife, but information is given for two), we must clarify that Richard Caswell had two marriages. The durations are 5 years for his first marriage and approximately 31 years for his second marriage.

Final Answer: 5 years for his first marriage and approximately 31 years for his second marriage."

","To find out how long V/Line was branded as an authority, we need to look at the formation dates provided in the table.

1. V/Line was first formed as a State Transport Authority brand on 1 July 1983.
2. It then became a statutory corporation on 1 October 2003.

The difference between these two dates will give us the duration for which V/Line was branded as an authority.

Calculating the difference:
- Starting date: 1 July 1983
- Ending date: 1 October 2003

From 1983 to 2003, there are 20 years. However, we need to account for the months as well because the starting date is in July and the ending date is in October, which means the full year of 2003 is not completed as a State Transport Authority brand, but since the question asks for years, we consider the full years completed.

So, V/Line was branded as an authority for approximately 20 years.

","To find out how long Valen Chapel was in operation after its completion, we first need to establish the year it was completed and then determine the years it was operational.

1. **Completion Year**: According to the table, Valen Chapel was completed in 1707.

2. **Operational Period**: The chapel was closed from 1873 to 1949. This means it was operational from 1707 to 1873 and then again from 1949 onwards.

3. **Calculating Operational Years**:
   - **First Operational Period (1707-1873)**: 1873 - 1707 = 166 years.
   - **Second Operational Period**: Since the question asks for the duration after completion and we're considering up to the point of the provided information (with no end date given for the second operational period), we calculate the years from 1949 until the present (assuming the current year is 2022, as per the instruction). So, 2022 - 1949 = 73 years.

4. **Total Operational Years After Completion**: Adding both operational periods gives us 166 years (before it was closed) + 73 years (after it was reopened) = 239 years.

","To find out how many days after its first flight the X-15 was introduced, we need to calculate the difference between the introduction date and the first flight date.

1. The first flight of the X-15 was on June 8, 1959.
2. The introduction of the X-15 was on September 17, 1959.
3. We calculate the difference in days between these two dates.

July has 31 days.
August has 31 days.
From September 1 to September 17, there are 17 days.

Adding these together: 22 (remaining days in June) + 31 (July) + 31 (August) + 17 (days in September up to the 17th) = 101 days.

","To find out how many days after launch Chandrayaan-2 landed on the moon, we need to calculate the difference between the launch date and the landing date.

1. **Launch Date and Time**: The launch date of Chandrayaan-2 was 22 July 2019, at 09:13:12 UTC.

2. **Landing Date and Time**: The intended landing date was 6 September 2019, but the actual landing attempt occurred at 20:23 UTC on this day. However, it's noted as a ""landing failure,"" which implies the landing did not succeed as planned. For the purpose of this calculation, we'll proceed with the date given, understanding that the landing was not successful.

3. **Calculate the Difference**:
   - Launch date: 22 July 2019
   - Landing date: 6 September 2019
   - To find the difference in days: 
     - July has 31 days, so from 22 July to 31 July is 9 days.
     - August has 31 days.
     - From 1 September to 6 September is 6 days.
     - Adding these together: 9 (remaining days in July) + 31 (days in August"

","To find out how many days after launch Chandrayaan-2's orbital insertion was held, we need to calculate the difference between the launch date and the orbital insertion date.

1. **Launch Date**: The launch date of Chandrayaan-2 was 22 July 2019.
2. **Orbital Insertion Date**: The orbital insertion into the Moon's orbit occurred on 20 August 2019.

Now, let's calculate the difference:

- July has 31 days, so from July 22 to July 31, there are 9 days.
- August 20, which means we add the entire month of July after the launch (9 days) and then 20 days in August.

So, the total number of days from the launch to the orbital insertion is 9 (remaining days in July) + 20 (days in August up to the 20th) = 29 days.

Therefore, Chandrayaan-2's orbital insertion was held 29 days after its launch.

","To find out how many days after the 2014 Ludian earthquake 112 people were reported missing, we need to compare the date of the earthquake with the date when the missing persons were reported.

1. The 2014 Ludian earthquake occurred on August 3, 2014, at 16:03:13 CST (UTC+8).
2. The information about 112 people missing is noted as ""As of 8 August 7:00 UTC"".

Given this, we calculate the difference in days between August 3 and August 8.

- August 3 to August 4 = 1 day
- August 4 to August 5 = 1 day
- August 5 to August 6 = 1 day
- August 6 to August 7 = 1 day
- August 7 to August 8 = 1 day

Therefore, from August 3 to August 8, there are 5 days.

","To find out how many days after the 2014 Ludian earthquake 617 people were reported dead, we need to look at the dates provided in the table.

1. The Local date of the earthquake is given as 3 August 2014.
2. The number of dead people (617) is reported as of 8 August 7:00 UTC.

Now, let's calculate the difference between these two dates:

- The earthquake occurred on 3 August 2014.
- The report of 617 dead is as of 8 August 2014.

So, the difference is 8 August - 3 August = 5 days.

Therefore, 617 people were reported dead 5 days after the 2014 Ludian earthquake.

","To find out how many days after the groundbreaking on 11 July 1939 the construction of All Hallows Twickenham was completed, we need to determine the completion date of the construction and then calculate the difference in days from the groundbreaking date.

1. **Groundbreaking Date**: The groundbreaking for All Hallows Twickenham took place on 11 July 1939.

2. **Completion Date**: The table does not directly provide a ""completion date"" for the construction. However, it mentions that the church was ""Consecrated"" on 9 November 1940. In the context of church construction, consecration is a significant event that typically marks the completion of the building to the point where it can be used for religious services. Therefore, we can use the consecration date as a proxy for the completion of the construction.

3. **Calculating the Difference**:
   - Start date: 11 July 1939
   - End date: 9 November 1940

To calculate the number of days between these two dates:
- From 11 July 1939 to 31 December 1939, there are 173 days (since July has 31 days, August has 31 days, September has 30 days, October"

- So, the total number of days from July 6 to August 10 is 25 (remaining days in July) + 10 (days in August up to the 10th) = 35 days.

Therefore, Jeffrey Edward Epstein was apprehended 35 days before his death.

Casualties

","To find out how many days before the 1960 Agadir earthquake the first foreshocks occurred, we need to compare the dates of the first foreshocks with the date of the earthquake.

1. The 1960 Agadir earthquake occurred on February 29, 1960.
2. The first foreshocks were reported on February 23, 1960.

Now, let's calculate the difference in days between these two dates:

- February 29, 1960 (earthquake date)
- February 23, 1960 (first foreshocks date)

Since February 29 is the day of the earthquake, we count backwards:
- February 28 (1 day before)
- February 27 (2 days before)
- February 26 (3 days before)
- February 25 (4 days before)
- February 24 (5 days before)
- February 23 (6 days before)

Therefore, the first foreshocks occurred 6 days before the 1960 Agadir earthquake.

","To find out how many days Jeffrey Epstein lived after he was apprehended on July 6, 2019, we need to calculate the difference between the date of his apprehension and the date of his death.

1. **Date of apprehension:** July 6, 2019
2. **Date of death:** August 10, 2019

Now, let's calculate the difference:

- July has 31 days. From July 6 to July 31, there are 25 days (31 - 6 = 25).
- August 10, so there are 10 days in August up to the point of his death.

Adding these together: 25 days (remaining in July) + 10 days (in August up to his death) = 35 days.

Therefore, Jeffrey Epstein lived for 35 days after he was apprehended on July 6, 2019.

","To determine the number of full months the 14 On Fire concert tour spanned, let's break down the information provided:

1. **Start date**: 21 February 2014
2. **End date**: 22 November 2014

Now, let's calculate the duration:

- The tour started in February 2014 and ended in November 2014.
- February to November includes the full months of March, April, May, June, July, August, September, October, and November. 
- Since the tour started on the 21st of February, February is not a full month.
- Similarly, since the tour ended on the 22nd of November, November is also not a full month in this context because it didn't span the entire month.

Thus, the full months included in the tour are March, April, May, June, July, August, September, and October, which totals 8 full months (from March to October, inclusive) plus the partial months of February and November.

However, the question specifically asks for ""full months,"" so we consider only the months that were fully covered by the tour, which are March through October.

Buried	Cathedral Cemetery, Pondicherry
Denomination	Catholic
Motto	Fides Vincit Mundum
Coat of arms	Ambrose Rayappan's coat of arms

","To find out how many full years passed between Ambrose Rayappan's ordination and consecration, we need to look at the dates provided for these two events.

1. **Ordination Date**: The table states that Ambrose Rayappan was ordained on 16 December 1923.
2. **Consecration Date**: It is mentioned that he was consecrated on 25 March 1953.

Now, let's calculate the difference:

- Ordination year: 1923
- Consecration year: 1953

The difference in years between these two dates is 1953 - 1923 = 30 years.

However, since the ordination occurred in December 1923 and the consecration in March 1953, we need to consider if this is a full 30 years or not. Given that the consecration happened before the end of the year in which the 30th anniversary of his ordination would occur (considering the ordination happened in December), it technically counts as 29 full years having passed, because the 30th year would only be complete after December 1953.

Therefore, between Ambrose Rayappan's ordination and consecration, 29 full years passed.

","To find out how many months after INS Trishul was ordered it was officially commissioned, we need to calculate the time difference between the date it was ordered and the date it was commissioned.

1. **Date Ordered:** INS Trishul was ordered on 17 November 1997.
2. **Date Commissioned:** It was commissioned on 25 June 2003.

Now, let's calculate the time difference:

- From November 1997 to December 1997 = 1 month
- From January 1998 to December 1998 = 12 months
- From January 1999 to December 1999 = 12 months

","To find out how many months after being apprehended Jeffrey Epstein committed suicide, we need to calculate the time difference between his apprehension and his death.

1. **Date of Apprehension**: Jeffrey Epstein was apprehended on July 6, 2019.
2. **Date of Death**: He died on August 10, 2019.

Given these dates, we can calculate the time difference:

- July has 31 days, so from July 6 to July 31, there are 25 days.
- August 10 is 10 days into August.

Therefore, the total number of days from July 6 to August 10 is 25 (remaining days in July) + 10 (days in August up to the 10th) = 35 days.

Since a month is approximately 30 days, 35 days is just over a month. However, the question asks for the number of months, and given that the events occurred within the same year and the time frame is less than two full months, we can approximate this to one month for simplicity, considering the question's context and available answer choices.

","To find out how many months after being recorded ""2 of Amerikaz Most Wanted"" was released, we need to follow these steps:

1. Identify the month and year the song was recorded.
2. Identify the month and year the song was released.
3. Calculate the difference in months between the release date and the recording date.

From the table, we can see that:

- The song was released on May 7, 1996.

Now, let's calculate the difference:
- From October 1995 to December 1995, there are 2 months.

","To find out how many months after deployment it took for Ingenuity to travel 7.17 km, we need to calculate the time difference between its deployment and the date it reached this distance.

1. **Deployment Date**: Ingenuity was deployed on 3 April 2021.
2. **Date of Traveling 7.17 km**: The table mentions that as of 11 June 2022, Ingenuity had traveled 7.17 km.

Now, let's calculate the time difference:

- **From April 2021 to April 2022**: This is exactly 1 year.
- **From April 2022 to June 2022**: This is 2 months.

Adding these together, we get 1 year and 2 months.

Since the question asks for the answer in months, we convert 1 year into months (1 year = 12 months) and then add the 2 months:

12 months (1 year) + 2 months = 14 months

Therefore, it took Ingenuity 14 months after its deployment to travel 7.17 km.

1. **Date of Arrest**: Epstein was arrested on July 6, 2019.
2. **Date of Death**: Epstein died on August 10, 2019.

Now, let's calculate the time difference between these two dates:

- August 10 is 10 days into August.

Therefore, the total number of days from July 6 to August 10 is 25 (remaining days in July) + 10 (days in August up to the 10th) = 35 days.

Since a month is approximately 30 days, we can estimate the number of months as follows:

35 days / 30 days per month ≈ 1.17 months

However, the question seems to ask for a whole number of months, and given the context, it's reasonable to interpret the answer as the number of whole months that have passed, which would be 1 month, considering the arrest happened early in July and the death occurred early in August.

     - March, April, May, June, July, August are 6 full months.

","To find out how many months after the UK nationwide release the US nationwide release was, we need to compare the release dates.

1. The UK nationwide release date is given as 24 November 1941.
2. The US nationwide release date is given as 15 April 1942.

Now, let's calculate the time difference:

- November 1941 to December 1941 = 1 month
- December 1941 to January 1942 = 1 month
- January 1942 to February 1942 = 1 month
- February 1942 to March 1942 = 1 month
- March 1942 to April 1942 = 1 month

So, from 24 November 1941 to 15 April 1942, there are approximately 5 months (considering the months as whole periods for simplicity, even though the exact days are not perfectly aligned).

","To find out how many months after the beginning of his reign as King of Burma Bayinnaung's coronation in Toungoo was, we need to calculate the time difference between the start of his reign and his coronation.

1. **Start of Reign**: Bayinnaung's reign as King of Burma began on 30 April 1550.
2. **Coronation in Toungoo**: His coronation in Toungoo took place on 11 January 1551.

Now, let's calculate the time difference:

- From 30 April 1550 to 31 December 1550, there are approximately 8 months.
- From 1 January 1551 to 11 January 1551, there are 11 days, which is less than a month.

So, adding these together, Bayinnaung's coronation in Toungoo occurred approximately 8 months and a bit more than a week after the beginning of his reign.

Given the options and the nature of the question, the closest approximation would be around 8 months, considering we're not provided with specific monthly options to choose from but rather a direct question asking for the calculation.

","To find out how many months after the first crewed flight the last flight was, let's break down the information:

1. **First crewed flight date**: April 12, 1981
2. **Last flight date**: July 21, 2011

Now, let's calculate the difference in months between these two dates:

- From April 1981 to April 2011, there are 30 years.
- Since the first crewed flight was in April and the last flight was in July, we need to add the months from April to July, which is 3 months.

So, the total number of months from the first crewed flight to the last flight is:
- 30 years * 12 months/year = 360 months
- Plus the 3 months from April to July = 363 months

Therefore, the last flight was 363 months after the first crewed flight.

Final Answer: The final answer is 363."

","To find out how many months after the first flight the X-15 was introduced, we need to calculate the time difference between the first flight and the introduction.

1. The first flight of the X-15 occurred on 8 June 1959.
2. The X-15 was introduced on 17 September 1959.
3. We calculate the difference:
   - June to September is 3 months.
   - Within June, from the 8th to the end of the month, and then all of July and August, and up to the 17th of September, we count the full months (July and August) and then the days from June 8 to June 30 (22 days) and from September 1 to September 17 (17 days).
   - However, for simplicity and given the question's nature, we focus on the months: The introduction happened 3 months after the first flight.

Therefore, the introduction of the X-15 happened 3 months after its first flight.

","To determine how many months after the first foreshock the last aftershock occurred, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Identify the dates of the first foreshock and the last aftershock.**
   - The first foreshock occurred on 23 February 1960.
   - The last aftershock occurred on 17 April 1960.

2. **Calculate the time difference between these two dates.**
   - From 23 February to 17 April, we are moving forward in the calendar.

3. **Count the months.**
   - February to March is 1 month.
   - March to April is another month.

So, from the first foreshock on 23 February 1960 to the last aftershock on 17 April 1960, it is approximately 2 months, considering the month of February as the starting point and counting the full months that follow until the event in April.

","To find out how many months after the launch date the moon lander's landing date was, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Identify the launch date**: The launch date of the Chandrayaan-2 mission was 22 July 2019.
2. **Identify the landing date**: The landing date of the moon lander (Vikram) was 6 September 2019.
3. **Calculate the time difference**: To find out how many months apart these dates are, we calculate the difference.
   - July to September is 2 months apart, since September is two months after July.
4. **Consider the days for a precise calculation**: While the primary question asks for months, understanding the day difference can refine our answer if needed. However, since the question does not ask for a precise day count but rather months, and given that the landing occurred early in September, the day difference does not alter the month count significantly enough to change the answer from a whole number of months.

Given these steps, the moon lander's landing date was approximately **2 months** after the launch date.

","To find out how many months after the release of the first single the album ""Confessions of a Dangerous Mind"" was released, we need to follow these steps:

1. Identify the release date of the first single.
2. Identify the release date of the album.
3. Calculate the time difference between these two dates in months.

Step 1: The first single released was ""Keanu Reeves"" on January 18, 2019.

Step 2: The album ""Confessions of a Dangerous Mind"" was released on May 10, 2019.

Step 3: To calculate the time difference, we subtract the release date of the single from the release date of the album. From January 18 to May 10, there are approximately 3.5 months (since January has about 12 days left after the 18th, all of February, all of March, all of April, and then 10 days into May).

However, for simplicity and given the nature of the question, we often round such periods to the nearest whole number if not specifically asked for partial months. But in this context, understanding it as ""how many months after"" implies counting full months elapsed between the events.

","To find out how many months after the start of the protests the death toll was 47 police officers and 7 soldiers, we need to follow these steps:

1. Identify the start date of the protests: The protests started on 2 February 2021.
2. Identify the date when the death toll was reported: The death toll of 47 police officers and 7 soldiers was reported as of 23 May 2021.
3. Calculate the time difference between these two dates to find out how many months after the start of the protests this death toll was reported.

The protests started on 2 February 2021, and the death toll was reported as of 23 May 2021. 

February to May is 3 months. Since the protests started on the 2nd of February and the death toll was reported on the 23rd of May, it is exactly 3 months and about 3 weeks later. However, the question seems to be asking for the number of months, which would be calculated as the difference between the two dates in terms of whole months.

Therefore, the death toll of 47 police officers and 7 soldiers was reported approximately 3 months after the start of the protests.

Death(s)	2,037 protesters (per AAPP) | 47 police officers and 7 soldiers | (per SAC; as of 23 May 2021)
Detained	11,286 detained currently, (per AAPP)

","To determine how many months ago the earliest detainees of the Myanmar Spring Revolution could have been detained, we need to consider the start date of the protests and the current date.

1. **Start Date of the Protests**: The 2021 Myanmar protests, also known as the Myanmar Spring Revolution, began on February 2, 2021, following the 2021 Myanmar coup d'état.

2. **Current Date**: Assuming the current date is December 2022, as given in the problem statement.

3. **Calculating the Time Elapsed**: To find out how many months ago the earliest detainees could have been detained, we calculate the time difference between the start of the protests (February 2, 2021) and the current date (December 2022).

From February 2021 to December 2022, there are 22 months (since 2021: March to December = 10 months, and 2022: January to December = 12 months, totaling 10 + 12 = 22 months).

However, since the question asks for ""how many months ago,"" we should consider the entire period from the beginning of the protests to the current date. Therefore, the earliest detainees could have been detained approximately 22 months ago"

","To find out how many months are left in the Mars Express mission duration, we first need to understand the current duration of the mission and its expected or planned duration. However, the table provided only gives us the elapsed time since launch and the time spent at Mars, but not the planned mission duration.

Given information:
- Elapsed time since launch: 19 years and 1 month
- Time at Mars: 18 years, 6 months, and 7 days

Since we don't have the planned mission duration, we cannot directly calculate how many months are left. The question seems to imply that we should calculate the remaining mission duration based on the provided elapsed times, but without a total planned mission duration, this calculation cannot be accurately performed.

However, if we were to interpret the question as asking for the difference in months between the total elapsed time and the time spent at Mars (which might not be the intended interpretation but is a possible approach given the data), we could proceed as follows:

1. Convert both durations into months for easier comparison:
   - Elapsed time since launch: 19 years * 12 months/year + 1 month = 229 months
   - Time at Mars: 18 years * 12 months/year + 6 months ="

1. ""Price to Play"" was released on April 1, 2003.

Next, we calculate the difference in months between these two dates.

- April 2003 to December 2003 encompasses 8 months (May, June, July, August, September, October, November, December).

However, the question asks how many months before ""Price to Play"" was ""How About You"" released. Since ""How About You"" was released after ""Price to Play"", it's not before but after. The correct interpretation of the question seems to be asking for the time difference, but given the phrasing, it implies looking for a period before ""Price to Play"", which doesn't apply as ""How About You"" comes later.

Given the context, it seems there might be confusion in the question's phrasing. If we're looking for how many months after ""Price to Play"" ""How About You"" was released, the answer would be 8 months. But if strictly interpreting ""before"" as asked,"

","To find out how many months the ""14 On Fire"" tour lasted, we need to calculate the duration from the start date to the end date.

1. The start date of the tour was 21 February 2014.
2. The end date of the tour was 22 November 2014.

Now, let's calculate the duration:

- February to November is 9 months apart (since November is the 11th month and February is the 2nd month, 11 - 2 = 9).
- However, we need to consider the days as well because the tour started on the 21st and ended on the 22nd.
- Since the tour started on the 21st of February and ended on the 22nd of November, it essentially lasted a full 9 months (from March to November, considering the start in February after the 21st), plus the remaining days from February 21st to the end of February, and from the start of November to November 22nd.

But for simplicity and the question's context, we usually calculate the duration in whole months for such periods, considering the start and end dates' proximity to the month's beginning and end.

Given the start and end dates, the tour lasted approximately"

","To determine how many months people experienced the effects of the 1960 Agadir earthquake, we need to consider the timeline of significant events related to the earthquake, such as the foreshocks, the main earthquake event, and the aftershocks.

1. **Foreshocks**: The table mentions foreshocks on 23 February and 29 February. These are indicators that seismic activity was increasing before the main event.
2. **Main Earthquake**: The main earthquake occurred on 29 February 1960.
3. **Aftershocks**: Significant aftershocks were recorded on 22 March and 17 April.

Given this information, we can calculate the duration during which people experienced the effects of the earthquake:

- The first foreshock mentioned was on 23 February.
- The last significant aftershock mentioned was on 17 April.

So, the period during which people experienced the effects of the earthquake includes February (when the foreshocks started), March (when an aftershock occurred), and April (when the last mentioned aftershock occurred).

Therefore, people experienced the effects of the 1960 Agadir earthquake for approximately **3 months** (February to April).

","To determine how many months Carlos Rosenkrantz has been in the office of Vice President of the Supreme Court of Argentina, we need to calculate the time elapsed since he took office.

1. **Identify the date Carlos Rosenkrantz took office**: According to the table, Carlos Rosenkrantz took office as Vice President of the Supreme Court on October 1, 2021.

2. **Determine the current date**: The problem doesn't specify the current date, but it mentions that the information is up to December 2022.

3. **Calculate the time elapsed**: From October 1, 2021, to December 2022, we calculate the months as follows:
   - The remainder of 2021 after October is November and December, which is 2 months.
   - The full year of 2022 is 12 months.
   - So, in total, from October 1, 2021, to December 2022, it is 2 (from 2021) + 12 (from 2022) = 14 months.

Therefore, Carlos Rosenkrantz has been in the office of Vice President of the Supreme Court of Argentina for 14 months as of December 2022.

1. **Date of Appointment**: Horacio Rosatti became the President of the Supreme Court on October 1, 2021.
2. **Current Date**: Since the question doesn't specify a particular date, we'll use the ""Cutting Knowledge Date"" provided, which is December 2022.

   - From October 2021 to December 2021, there are 3 months (October, November, December).
   - From January 2022 to December 2022, there are 12 months.
   - Adding these together: 3 months (from 2021) + 12 months (from 2022) = 15 months.

['Black rocket aircraft with stubby wings and short vertical stabilizers above and below tail unit', 'The X-15 pulling away from its drop launch plane']

","To find out how many months separated the introduction of the X-15 from its first flight, we need to calculate the time difference between the two dates given.

1. The first flight of the X-15 was on 8 June 1959.
2. The introduction of the X-15 was on 17 September 1959.

Now, let's calculate the difference:

- June to September is 3 months.
- Within June, the flight happened on the 8th.
- Within September, the introduction happened on the 17th.

Since the introduction happened after the first flight, we simply count the months: June to July is 1 month, July to August is another month, and August to September is yet another month, making it 3 months. 

Considering the days within the months (8th of June to 17th of September), the exact difference is not just the months but also includes the days. However, the question seems to focus on the month difference, which we've identified as 3 months.

","To find out how many more years Libya supported the EPRDF than the other side in the Ethiopian Civil War, we need to look at the duration of Libya's support for each side.

1. **Identify the years Libya supported each side:**
   - Libya supported the Derg (the other side) from 1977 to 1985.
   - Libya supported the EPRDF from 1985 to 1991.

2. **Calculate the duration of support for each side:**
   - Duration supporting the Derg: 1985 - 1977 = 8 years.
   - Duration supporting the EPRDF: 1991 - 1985 = 6 years.

3. **Determine the difference in support duration:**
   - However, the question asks for how many more years Libya supported the EPRDF than the other side. Given the calculations, Libya actually supported the Derg for 8 years and the EPRDF for 6 years, meaning it supported the Derg for more years.

4. **Correct the understanding of the question:**
   - Since Libya supported the Derg for 8 years and the EPRDF for 6 years, it did not support the EPRDF for more years"

   - Gabi Ashkenazi was a leader from 2006 to 2011, which means he was involved for 5 years.

2. **Calculate the difference in their involvement years:**
   - To find out how many more years Ashkenazi was a leader compared to Olmert, we subtract the number of years Olmert was involved from the number of years Ashkenazi was involved.
   - Difference = Years Ashkenazi was involved - Years Olmert was involved
   - Difference = 5 years - 3 years = 2 years

","To find out how many more years Mostafa Pourmohammadi was a leader than Ali Shamkhani, we first need to identify the years each of them served as leaders in the context of the Iran-PJAK conflict.

1. **Identify the years Ali Shamkhani served:** According to the table, Ali Shamkhani served from 2004 to 2005. This means he served for 1 year.

2. **Identify the years Mostafa Pourmohammadi served:** Mostafa Pourmohammadi served from 2005 until 19 May 2008. This means he served for approximately 3 years.

3. **Calculate the difference in their service years:** To find out how many more years Mostafa Pourmohammadi served compared to Ali Shamkhani, we subtract the number of years Ali Shamkhani served from the number of years Mostafa Pourmohammadi served. So, 3 years (Mostafa Pourmohammadi) - 1 year (Ali Shamkhani) = 2 years.

Therefore, Mostafa Pourmohammadi served 2 more years than Ali Shamkhani.

","To determine the total number of years Roy Emerson played as both an amateur and a professional, we need to look at the information provided in the table regarding when he started his amateur tour and when he retired.

1. **Amateur Tour Start**: The table states that Roy Emerson was on the amateur tour from 1953.
2. **Turned Pro**: It is mentioned that he turned pro in 1968.
3. **Retired**: The year of his retirement is given as 1983.

Now, let's calculate the total years he played:

1. Art Carney married Jean Myers in 1940.
2. They divorced in 1965.
3. This means they were married for 25 years (from 1940 to 1965).
4. However, it's also mentioned that they married again in 1980, but there's no specific end date mentioned for this second marriage.

Given the information provided, we can only calculate the duration of their first marriage with certainty, which is 25 years.

","To find out how many years after Kristina Gorshkova began skating she won her first medal at the Junior Grand Prix Final, let's break down the information:

1. **Year Kristina Gorshkova began skating:** 1993
2. **Year she won her first medal at the Junior Grand Prix Final:** 2007-08 (for the purpose of calculating years, we'll consider this as 2008, since the event would have taken place at the end of 2007 or beginning of 2008, but the year is often represented in this combined format for seasons).

Now, let's calculate the difference:

- **Started skating in 1993**
- **Won the medal in 2008**

Difference = 2008 - 1993 = 15 years

Therefore, Kristina Gorshkova won her first medal at the Junior Grand Prix Final 15 years after she began skating.

","To find out how many years after Miloš Obrenović's reign as Grand Vožd of Serbia ended did his second reign as Prince of Serbia begin, we need to look at the dates provided in the table for these events.

1. **Reign as Grand Vožd of Serbia**: This ended on 6 November 1817.
2. **Reign as Prince of Serbia**: This began on 6 November 1817.

Given that both the end of his reign as Grand Vožd and the beginning of his reign as Prince of Serbia occur on the same date, 6 November 1817, it indicates that there was no gap between these two reigns. They essentially started and ended on the same day, with Miloš transitioning from one title to the other.

Therefore, his second reign as Prince of Serbia began immediately after his reign as Grand Vožd of Serbia ended, meaning there are 0 years between the end of one and the start of the other.

","To find out how many years after it was built the Palace of Westminster caught on fire, we need to know two key dates: the year it was built and the year it caught on fire.

1. **Year Built**: According to the table, the Palace of Westminster was built in 1016.

2. **Year of Fire**: The table mentions that the Palace of Westminster was demolished in 1834 due to a fire. This implies that the fire occurred in 1834.

3. **Calculating the Years**: To find out how many years after it was built the Palace of Westminster caught on fire, we subtract the year it was built from the year of the fire.
   
   Years after built = Year of fire - Year built
   Years after built = 1834 - 1016
   Years after built = 818 years

","To determine how many years the Firefly was in service after its introduction, we need to subtract the year of its introduction from the year it was retired.

1. Introduction year: The Firefly was introduced in March 1943.
2. Retirement year: The Firefly was retired in 1956 (specifically from the Royal Navy).
3. Calculate the years in service: Subtract the introduction year from the retirement year.

Years in service = Retirement year - Introduction year
Years in service = 1956 - 1943
Years in service = 13

So, the Firefly was in service for 13 years after its introduction.

","To find out how many years after the French occupation of Algeria its independence was, we need to subtract the year of the French occupation from the year of independence.

1. **Identify the year of French occupation**: According to the table, the French occupation of Algeria started on July 5, 1830.

2. **Identify the year of independence**: The table states that Algeria gained its independence on July 5, 1962.

3. **Calculate the difference**: Subtract the year of the French occupation from the year of independence to find out how many years passed between these two events.
   - Year of independence: 1962
   - Year of French occupation: 1830
   - Difference: 1962 - 1830 = 132 years

Therefore, Algeria's independence was 132 years after the French occupation.

Final Answer: 132 years"

","To find out how many years after the Men's 4 × 200 metre freestyle relay at the Games of the XXXI Olympiad the next related event was, let's break down the information provided:

1. The Men's 4 × 200 metre freestyle relay at the Games of the XXXI Olympiad took place in 2016, as indicated by the date ""9 August 2016"" for the heats and final.

2. The next related event would be the same competition but at the subsequent Olympiad. The Olympiads are held every 4 years.

3. Therefore, to find the year of the next related event after 2016, we add 4 years to 2016.

4. 2016 + 4 = 2020.

So, the next related event, which is the Men's 4 × 200 metre freestyle relay at the Games of the XXXII Olympiad, was held 4 years after the event at the Games of the XXXI Olympiad.

","To find out how many years after the economic aid of $9.50 billion the revenues of the French economy reached 52.6% of GDP, we need to determine the year the economic aid was given and the year the revenues reached 52.6% of GDP.

1. **Economic Aid Year**: The economic aid of $9.50 billion was given in 2016, as stated in the table under ""Economic aid"" with the specification ""donor: ODA, $9.50 billion (2016)"".

3. **Calculating the Difference**: To find out how many years after the economic aid the revenues reached 52.6% of GDP, we subtract the year of the economic aid from the year the revenues reached 52.6% of GDP. So, 2019 - 2016 = 3 years.

","To find out how many years after the first edition the 5th edition of CATAN was released, we need to determine the release years of both the first and the fifth editions and then calculate the difference.

1. **First Edition Release Year**: According to the table, the first edition of CATAN was released in 1995.

2. **Fifth Edition Release Year**: The table states that the fifth edition was released in June 2015.

3. **Calculating the Difference**: To find out how many years after the first edition the fifth edition was released, we subtract the release year of the first edition from the release year of the fifth edition.
   
   Fifth edition year - First edition year = 2015 - 1995 = 20 years

Therefore, the fifth edition of CATAN was released 20 years after the first edition.

2. Determine the year when the United States was allegedly supporting Iran in this conflict.
3. Calculate the difference between these two years to find out how many years after the start of the conflict the U.S. support began.

From the given table, we can see that:
- The Iran-PJAK conflict started on 1 April 2004.
- The United States is alleged by PJAK to have supported Iran since 2009.

Now, calculating the difference:
2009 (year of alleged U.S. support) - 2004 (start year of the conflict) = 5 years.

Therefore, the United States was allegedly a supporter of Iran 5 years after the start of the Iran-PJAK conflict.

","To find out how many years ago AT&T Inc. was founded, we first need to identify the founding date and then calculate the difference between that date and the current year (2022).

1. **Identify the founding date**: According to the table, AT&T Inc. was founded on October 5, 1983.

2. **Calculate the difference**: To find out how many years ago AT&T Inc. was founded, we subtract the founding year from the current year.
   
   Current year: 2022
   Founding year: 1983
   
   Difference = Current year - Founding year = 2022 - 1983 = 39 years

Therefore, as of 2022, AT&T Inc. was founded 39 years ago.

","To find out how many years ago Nate Archibald was inducted into the Basketball Hall of Fame, we need to follow these steps:

1. Identify the year Nate Archibald was inducted into the Basketball Hall of Fame. However, the provided table does not specify the year he was inducted into the Basketball Hall of Fame, but it mentions he was inducted into the College Basketball Hall of Fame in 2006.

2. Since the specific year of induction into the Basketball Hall of Fame is not provided, we cannot directly calculate the number of years ago he was inducted based on the given information. 

3. Normally, to calculate how many years ago an event occurred, we would subtract the year the event happened from the current year.

1. Identify the year when Yale University was named Collegiate School. According to the table, Yale University was named Collegiate School from 1701 to 1718.

The table mentions that the university was established on October 9, 1701, and also provides information about its endowment in 2021, and student numbers in 2019 and 2020. However, for calculating years ago, we should consider the current year mentioned or implied in the context. The table does not explicitly state the current year, but given the information provided (such as the endowment in 2021), we can infer that the current year for the context of this question is 2022.

","To answer this question, we need to follow these steps:

1. Identify the decommissioning date of the INS Vikramaditya when it was part of the Soviet Union/Russia, which was before it was sold to India. According to the table, when the ship was known as Admiral Gorshkov, it was decommissioned in 1996.

2. Determine the current year to calculate how many years ago the decommissioning occurred. The current year is given as 2022 (since the current date is December 2022).

3. Calculate the difference between the current year (2022) and the year the Admiral Gorshkov was decommissioned (1996) to find out how many years ago it was decommissioned.

The calculation is as follows: 2022 - 1996 = 26 years.

Therefore, the INS Vikramaditya (when it was known as Admiral Gorshkov) was decommissioned 26 years ago in the Soviet Union/Russia.

","To find out how many years ago the New York Stock Exchange was founded, we need to calculate the difference between the current year (2022) and the year it was founded (1792).

1. Identify the founding year of the New York Stock Exchange: 1792
2. Identify the current year: 2022
3. Calculate the difference between the current year and the founding year: 2022 - 1792 = 230 years

However, the table also provides this information directly: ""Founded: May 17, 1792 | ; 229 years ago |"". This means that as of the last update, it had been 229 years since the founding. Given that the current year is 2022, and assuming the last update was in 2021 (since market cap is given for 2021), the calculation matches the provided information if we consider the update was before May 17, 2021.

Since the question asks how many years ago it was founded, and considering the information provided in the table is as of a point before May 17, 2021, the correct answer based on the table's own calculation is 229 years ago as of the last full year before the update.

","To find the number of years between Argentina's first international match and their biggest defeat by Czechoslovakia, we need to follow these steps:

1. Identify the date of Argentina's first international match.
2. Identify the date of Argentina's biggest defeat by Czechoslovakia.
3. Calculate the difference in years between these two dates.

Step 1: Argentina's first international match was on 20 July 1902.

Step 2: Argentina's biggest defeat by Czechoslovakia was on 15 June 1958.

Step 3: To find the difference in years, we subtract the year of the first match from the year of the biggest defeat: 1958 - 1902 = 56 years.

Therefore, there are 56 years between Argentina's first international match and their biggest defeat by Czechoslovakia.

","To determine how many years Ambrose Rayappan served as Archbishop Emeritus of Pondicherry and Cuddalore, we need to establish the start and end dates of his tenure in this position.

1. **Start Date as Archbishop Emeritus**: The table does not explicitly mention when Ambrose Rayappan became the Archbishop Emeritus, but we can infer it from the information given. He ended his term as Archbishop on 17 March 1973. Typically, an Archbishop Emeritus title is conferred upon a bishop after they have retired from their position. Therefore, it's reasonable to assume that Ambrose Rayappan became Archbishop Emeritus after 17 March 1973.

2. **End Date as Archbishop Emeritus**: This would be the date of his death, as the title of Archbishop Emeritus is usually held until death. According to the table, Ambrose Rayappan died on 24 November 1999.

3. **Calculating the Years Served**: To find out how many years he served as Archbishop Emeritus, we subtract the year he became Archbishop Emeritus from the year he died. Given that he became Archbishop Emeritus in 1973 and died in 1999, the calculation would be 1999 - 1973 ="

2. **Identify the previous team managed by Antonio Mohamed before Atlético Mineiro**: Looking at the ""Teams managed"" section, we see that before managing Atlético Mineiro (starting in 2022), Mohamed managed ""Monterrey"" from 2019-2020.

3. **Determine the years Mohamed managed Monterrey before managing Atlético Mineiro**: Since Mohamed managed Monterrey from 2019-2020 and then started managing Atlético Mineiro in 2022, we need to calculate the duration between the end of his management at Monterrey and the start of his management at Atlético Mineiro.

","To determine how many years Argentina supported the Salvadoran Civil War, we need to consider the duration of the war and the specific time frame during which Argentina provided support.

1. **Duration of the Salvadoran Civil War**: The war lasted from October 15, 1979, to January 16, 1992, which is approximately 12 years and 3 months.

2. **Argentina's Support**: According to the information provided in the table under ""Belligerents,"" Argentina supported the FMLN (one of the factions involved in the civil war) until 1983.

Given that the war started in 1979 and Argentina's support ended in 1983, we can calculate the duration of Argentina's support as follows:

- Starting year: 1979
- Ending year: 1983

Therefore, Argentina supported the Salvadoran Civil War for approximately 4 years (from 1979 to 1983).

","To find out how many years Bayinnaung ruled as the Suzerain of Siam, we need to look at the dates provided for his reign over Siam.

1. **Identify the start date of Bayinnaung's reign as Suzerain of Siam**: According to the table, Bayinnaung started his reign as Suzerain of Siam on 18 February 1564.

2. **Identify the end date of Bayinnaung's reign as Suzerain of Siam**: The table states that his reign ended on 10 October 1581.

3. **Calculate the duration of his reign as Suzerain of Siam**: To find the number of years, we subtract the start year from the end year and then consider the months to ensure accuracy.

- Start year: 1564
- End year: 1581

The difference in years is 1581 - 1564 = 17 years.

However, since his reign started in February 1564 and ended in October 1581, we need to consider if this affects the calculation. Given that he ruled for more than 17 full years (from February 1564 to October 1581 includes parts of 18 years),"

","To find out how many years Bill Hosket played in his career, we need to look at the information provided in the ""Career information"" and ""Career history"" sections of the table.

1. **Identify the start year of his career**: According to the table, Bill Hosket was drafted into the NBA in 1968 and started his playing career the same year.

2. **Identify the end year of his career**: The table states that his playing career lasted until 1972.

3. **Calculate the duration of his career**: To find out how many years he played, we subtract the start year from the end year and then add 1 (since we are counting the years inclusively). So, 1972 - 1968 + 1 = 4 + 1 = 5, but since the calculation directly gives us the span (1972 - 1968 = 4), and considering that his career started in 1968 and ended in 1972, it indeed lasted for 4 years.

In the ""Career history"" section, it is mentioned that Chuck Howley played for the 'los Raiders (1961-1973)'. 

Now, let's calculate the number of years he played for the Los Raiders. The years are given as 1961 to 1973. 

1961 to 1973 includes 13 years (1973 - 1961 + 1 = 13).

So, Chuck Howley played for the Los Raiders for 13 years (1961-1973), but it seems there is a small typo in the team's name which should likely be 'Los Angeles Raiders' or simply 'Raiders' as 'los Raiders' doesn't match any well-known NFL team name directly. However, based on the context, it's clear the reference is to the Raiders team that was in Los Angeles during part of the mentioned period.

1. The ""Playing career"" section directly states the years during which James Worthy played professionally: ""1982-1994"".

2. This range gives us the starting and ending years of his professional playing career.

3. To find the total number of years, we subtract the starting year from the ending year and then add 1 (since both the starting and ending years are inclusive).

4. Calculation: 1994 - 1982 + 1 = 12 + 1 = 13, but since the calculation directly gives us the difference and we're including both ends, the correct approach is simply 1994 - 1982 = 12 years of playing, considering the inclusive nature of the range, it indeed confirms 12 years of professional play without needing to add 1 in this context.

","To find out how many years Melissa L. Coates worked professionally, we need to look at the duration of her professional career in both bodybuilding and professional wrestling.

1. **Professional Wrestling Career**: According to the table, Melissa Coates debuted in professional wrestling in 2002 and retired in 2020. So, the duration of her professional wrestling career is 2020 - 2002 = 18 years.

2. **Bodybuilding Career**: Her pro-debut in bodybuilding was in 1996 at the IFBB Jan Tana Classic. However, the table does not specify the year she retired from bodybuilding. Since it's mentioned that she retired from professional wrestling in 2020 and there's no specific information about her continuing bodybuilding after her wrestling career started, we might assume her primary focus shifted to wrestling. But to calculate the total years she worked professionally, we consider her bodybuilding career started in 1996.

Given the information, if we consider her professional career as a whole (both bodybuilding and wrestling), and assuming she was active in bodybuilding until she started wrestling in 2002 (since we don't have the exact year she stopped bodybuilding), she worked professionally from 1996 to 2020, which is "

","To determine the total number of years Mohammad-Ali Foroughi served as Prime Minister of Iran, we need to calculate the duration of each term and then sum them up.

1. First term: 1 November 1925 - 13 June 1926. This term lasted approximately 7 months.
2. Second term: 18 September 1933 - 3 December 1935. This term lasted approximately 2 years and 2.5 months.
3. Third term: 27 August 1941 - 9 March 1942. This term lasted approximately 6 months.

Now, let's convert these durations into years:
- The first term was about 7 months, which is 7/12 = 0.583 years.
- The second term was about 2 years and 2.5 months, which is 2 + (2.5/12) = 2.208 years.
- The third term was about 6 months, which is 6/12 = 0.5 years.

Adding these together: 0.583 + 2.208 + 0.5 = 3.291 years.

So, Mohammad-Ali Foroughi served as Prime Minister of Iran for approximately 3"

","To find out how many years Nate Archibald played professionally, we need to look at the information provided in the ""Career information"" and ""Career history"" sections of the table.

1. **Identify the start year of his professional career**: According to the table, under ""Career information"", Nate Archibald was drafted into the NBA in 1970. This is the starting point of his professional career.

2. **Identify the end year of his professional career**: In the same section, it's mentioned that his ""Playing career"" spanned from 1970 to 1984. This directly tells us the duration of his professional career.

","To find out how many years Scottie Pippen played between his stints in Chicago, we first need to identify the years he played for the Chicago Bulls and then calculate the gap between those periods.

1. **Identify the years Pippen played for the Chicago Bulls:** According to the table, Pippen played for the Chicago Bulls from 1987 to 1998 and then again from 2003 to 2004.

2. **Calculate the gap between the two stints in Chicago:** The first stint ended in 1998, and the second stint began in 2003. Therefore, the gap between these two stints is 2003 - 1998 = 5 years.

However, we need to consider if he played anywhere during this gap. According to the table, after leaving the Chicago Bulls in 1998, Pippen played for the Houston Rockets in 1999 and then for the Portland Trail Blazers from 1999 to 2003 before returning to the Chicago Bulls.

Since the question asks for the years played between his stints in Chicago, and we've established that Pippen played for other teams during this period (1999-2003), we confirm that he was actively playing in the NBA during the years between his Chicago"

","To determine the number of years Zinedine Zidane spent in the youth division, we need to examine the ""Youth career"" section of the table.

1. **Identify the start and end years of the youth career**: The earliest year mentioned in the youth career section is 1981, and the latest year is 1989.

2. **Calculate the duration**: Subtract the start year from the end year and then add 1 to include both the start and end years in the count.
   
   Duration = End year - Start year + 1
             = 1989 - 1981 + 1
             = 8 + 1
             = 9 years

However, it's also important to consider the specific teams and years mentioned to ensure accuracy:
- 1981-1982: AS Foresta
- 1982-1983: US Saint-Henri
- 1983-1986: SO Septèmes-les-Vallons
- 1986-1989: Cannes

Given these details, Zidane's youth career indeed spans from 1981 to 1989, which encompasses 8 years of activity within different youth teams.

**Final Answer:** Zinedine Zid"

","To find out how many years it took Sri Lanka to become a full ICC member after becoming an Associate member, we need to look at the years provided in the table for these events.

1. **Identify the year Sri Lanka became an Associate Member**: According to the table, Sri Lanka became an Associate Member of the ICC in 1965.

2. **Identify the year Sri Lanka became a Full Member**: The table states that Sri Lanka acquired Full Member status in 1981.

3. **Calculate the difference in years**: To find out how many years it took for Sri Lanka to become a Full Member after being an Associate Member, we subtract the year of becoming an Associate Member from the year of becoming a Full Member.
   
   Years taken = Year of Full Membership - Year of Associate Membership
               = 1981 - 1965
               = 16 years

Therefore, it took Sri Lanka 16 years to become a Full ICC member after becoming an Associate member.

","To determine how many years it took for the Human Development Index (HDI) of France to grow by 0.089 points, we need to look at the information provided in the table regarding the HDI values and their respective years.

From the table, we have two HDI values for France:
1. 0.909 (for the year 2020)
2. 0.820 (for the year 2019)

First, let's calculate the difference in HDI between these two years:
0.909 (2020) - 0.820 (2019) = 0.089

Since the difference in HDI is exactly 0.089 points over one year (from 2019 to 2020), it directly answers our question.

The final answer is: $\boxed{1}$"

","To find out how many years it took for the NYSE to go from a US$20.161 trillion volume to a US$26.2 trillion market cap, we first need to identify the years associated with these figures.

1. The volume of US$20.161 trillion is noted as being for the year 2011.
2. The market cap of US$26.2 trillion is noted as being for the year 2021.

Next, we calculate the difference in years between these two dates to find out how many years it took for the NYSE to reach the market cap of US$26.2 trillion from the noted volume in 2011.

2021 (year of market cap) - 2011 (year of volume) = 10 years

Therefore, it took 10 years for the NYSE to go from a US$20.161 trillion volume to a US$26.2 trillion market cap, based on the information provided.

","To determine how many years it took to rebuild the Palace of Westminster, we need to look at the information provided in the table regarding the years of demolition and rebuilding.

1. The Palace of Westminster was demolished in 1834 due to a fire.
2. It was rebuilt between 1840 and 1876.

Now, let's calculate the number of years it took to rebuild the palace:

Rebuilding started in 1840 and was completed in 1876. 

So, the duration of rebuilding = Year of completion - Year of start
= 1876 - 1840
= 36 years

Therefore, it took 36 years to rebuild the Palace of Westminster.

","To find out how many years the consecration of Valen Chapel took after it was closed, we first need to identify the year it was closed and the year it was consecrated.

1. **Identify the year the chapel was closed**: According to the table, the chapel was closed from 1873 to 1949. This means it was closed for 76 years, but the specific year we are interested in for the calculation is 1873, when it first closed.

2. **Identify the year the chapel was consecrated**: The table states that the chapel was consecrated on 31 July 1949.

3. **Calculate the difference in years**: Since the chapel was closed from 1873 to 1949 and was consecrated in 1949, we calculate the difference from the start of its closure to its consecration. 
   - The year it was closed is 1873.
   - The year it was consecrated is 1949.
   - Difference = 1949 - 1873 = 76 years.

Therefore, the consecration of Valen Chapel took place 76 years after it was initially closed.

","To find out how many years Bev Francis's career lasted when she debuted her first match, we need to look at the information provided about her professional career, specifically the year of her pro-debut and the year she retired.

1. **Pro-debut year**: The table mentions that Bev Francis made her pro-debut at the ""Caesars World Cup"" in 1983.
2. **Retirement year**: It's stated that she retired in 1991.

Now, to calculate the duration of her career, we subtract the year of her pro-debut from the year of her retirement:

1991 (retirement year) - 1983 (pro-debut year) = 8 years

However, the question asks how many years her career had lasted ""when she debuted her first match."" Since the debut is the starting point of her career, at the moment of her debut, her career had not lasted any years yet because it was just beginning.

Therefore, when Bev Francis debuted her first match in 1983, her career had lasted 0 years, as it was the starting point.

The table provides information on the introduction of the JF-17 Thunder, stating that its introduction was on ""12 March 2007"" and that production in China started in ""June 2007"". However, it does not explicitly state when the aircraft was first used in service in China.

Given the information:
- Introduction date: 12 March 2007
- Production in China started: June 2007

Since the question asks for how many years the JF-17 Thunder has been used in China and considering that the current year is 2022, we calculate the time elapsed since its introduction and the start of production.

1. Introduction to service: 2022 - 2007 = 15 years

Therefore, the next album, ""Chapter V"", was released 2 years after ""14 Shades of Grey"".

","To determine the length of the last reign of the Kalmar Union, we need to identify the start and end years of the last monarch's rule.

1. **Identify the last monarch**: According to the table, the last monarch of the Kalmar Union was Christian II, who ruled from 1513 to 1523.

2. **Calculate the length of the reign**: To find out how many years Christian II ruled, we subtract the start year from the end year.
   - Start year: 1513
   - End year: 1523
   - Length of reign = End year - Start year = 1523 - 1513 = 10 years

Therefore, the last reign of the Kalmar Union, under Christian II, was 10 years long.

   - The second period (2008-2011) is 3 years.
   - In 2017, it's mentioned he managed them, but since it's just the year without specifying the duration, we'll consider it as 1 year for simplicity, assuming he managed for the whole year or at least part of it.

1. **Chicago Bulls**: Pippen played for the Chicago Bulls from 1987 to 1998 and then again from 2003 to 2004. 
   - First stint: 1987-1998 = 11 years

1. **Years with the New York Giants**: According to the table, Art Wilson played for the New York Giants from 1908 to 1913. This means he played for the Giants for 5 years (1913 - 1908 = 5).

2. **Years with the Boston Braves**: The table indicates that Art Wilson played for the Boston Braves from 1918 to 1920. This means he played for the Braves for 3 years (1920 - 1918 = 2, but since he played in both 1918 and 1920, it includes the years 1918, 1919, and 1920, hence 3 years).

3. **Difference in years**: To find out how many years longer he played for the Giants than the Braves, we subtract the number of years played for the Braves from the number of years played for the Giants. So, 5 years (Giants) - 3 years (Braves) = 2 years.

","To find out how many years longer the orbiter's planned mission duration is than its current elapsed duration, we need to compare the two durations.

1. The planned mission duration for the orbiter is approximately 7.5 years.
2. The elapsed mission duration for the orbiter is 2 years and 10 months.

First, we need to convert the elapsed duration into just years to make the comparison easier. Since there are 12 months in a year, 10 months is equal to 10/12 = 0.8333 years.

So, the total elapsed duration in years is 2 years + 0.8333 years = 2.8333 years.

Now, we subtract the elapsed duration from the planned duration to find the difference:
7.5 years (planned) - 2.8333 years (elapsed) = 4.6667 years.

Therefore, the orbiter's planned mission duration is approximately 4.67 years longer than its current elapsed duration.

","To find out how many years longer Franchitti's IndyCar Series career was than his NASCAR Camping World Truck Series career, we need to determine the length of each career.

1. **IndyCar Series Career Length**: 
   - First race: 2002 Indianapolis 500
   - Last race: 2013 Grand Prix of Houston
   - Therefore, his IndyCar Series career spanned from 2002 to 2013, which is 11 years.

2. **NASCAR Camping World Truck Series Career Length**:
   - First race: 2007 Kroger 200
   - Since it's mentioned that he ran 2 races over 1 year, we don't need the last race to calculate the career length.
   - Therefore, his NASCAR Camping World Truck Series career spanned 1 year.

3. **Comparison**:
   - IndyCar Series career length: 11 years
   - NASCAR Camping World Truck Series career length: 1 year
   - Difference: 11 years - 1 year = 10 years

Therefore, Franchitti's IndyCar Series career was 10 years longer than his NASCAR Camping World Truck Series career.

","To find out how many years longer Gagauzia was an unrecognized breakaway state compared to Tatarstan, we need to look at the duration each was an unrecognized breakaway state.

1. **Identify the duration for Gagauzia:** According to the table, Gagauzia was an unrecognized breakaway state from 1990 to 1994. This means it was a breakaway state for 4 years.

2. **Identify the duration for Tatarstan:** The table states that Tatarstan was an unrecognized breakaway state from 1992 to 1994. This means it was a breakaway state for 2 years.

3. **Calculate the difference:** To find out how many years longer Gagauzia was an unrecognized breakaway state compared to Tatarstan, we subtract the number of years Tatarstan was a breakaway state from the number of years Gagauzia was. So, 4 years (Gagauzia) - 2 years (Tatarstan) = 2 years.

Therefore, Gagauzia was an unrecognized breakaway state 2 years longer than Tatarstan.

1. **NASCAR Xfinity Series career duration**: Gordon's first race in the NASCAR Xfinity Series was in 2001, and his last race was in 2011. Therefore, the duration of his NASCAR Xfinity Series career is 2011 - 2001 = 10 years.

3. **Comparing the durations**: To find out how many years longer Gordon's NASCAR Xfinity Series career was than his IndyCar Series career, we subtract the duration of the IndyCar Series career from the duration of the NASCAR Xfinity Series career.

","To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps.

1. **Identify the years of service for both Habte Giyorgis and Yekuno Amlak:**
   - Habte Giyorgis was the first Prime Minister, serving from 1909 to 1927.
   - Yekuno Amlak was the first emperor, serving from 1270 to 1285.

2. **Calculate the duration of service for each:**
   - Habte Giyorgis served for 1927 - 1909 = 18 years.
   - Yekuno Amlak served for 1285 - 1270 = 15 years.

3. **Find the difference in their years of service:**
   - The difference in their years of service is 18 (Habte Giyorgis) - 15 (Yekuno Amlak) = 3 years.

Therefore, Habte Giyorgis was Prime Minister for 3 years longer than Yekuno Amlak was emperor.

2. **Identify the years France was involved:** France was involved from 1977 to 1978, which means they were involved for 1 year.

3. **Calculate the difference in years:** To find out how many years longer Mauritania was a belligerent than France, we subtract the number of years France was involved from the number of years Mauritania was involved. So, 4 years (Mauritania) - 1 year (France) = 3 years.

Therefore, Mauritania was a belligerent for 3 years longer than France.

","To find out how many years longer Mohammad-Ali Foroughi's second term as the 22nd Prime Minister of Iran was than his first term, we need to calculate the duration of each term and then compare them.

1. **First Term:** The first term started on 1 November 1925 and ended on 13 June 1926. This term lasted approximately 7 months.

2. **Second Term:** The second term started on 18 September 1933 and ended on 3 December 1935. This term lasted approximately 2 years and 2.5 months.

3. **Comparison:** To compare, we convert both terms into a common unit. Let's use months for simplicity:
   - The first term was approximately 7 months.
   - The second term was approximately 2 years and 2.5 months, which is 26 months.

4. **Difference Calculation:** The difference in duration between the second term and the first term is 26 months (second term) - 7 months (first term) = 19 months.

5. **Conversion to Years:** Since the question asks for the difference in years, we convert 19 months to years. There are approximately 12 months in a year, so:

","To determine how many years longer Watanjar's third term as Minister of Internal Affairs was than his first term, let's first identify the dates for both terms.

1. **First term as Minister of Internal Affairs**: 
   - Started: 8 July 1978
   - Ended: 1979

   Since the exact end date in 1979 is not provided, we'll consider the term to be approximately 1 year, given that it started in July 1978 and ended sometime in 1979.

2. **Third term as Minister of Internal Affairs**:
   - Started: 15 November 1988
   - Ended: 6 March 1990

   This term lasted from November 1988 to March 1990, which is approximately 1 year and 4 months. For simplicity, we can consider this to be roughly 1.3 years.

Now, comparing the two terms:
- The first term was approximately 1 year.
- The third term was approximately 1.3 years.

The difference in length between the third term and the first term is 1.3 years - 1 year = 0.3 years.

1. **First Renovation**: The first renovation took place in 2009. Since it's mentioned as a single year, we can assume it was a renovation that occurred within that year or started and ended within 2009, implying it lasted for approximately 1 year.

2. **Second Renovation**: The second renovation is stated to have occurred from 2019 to 2021. This indicates that the renovation started in 2019 and was completed by 2021, lasting approximately 2 years.

3. **Comparison**: To find out how many years longer the second renovation was than the first, we subtract the duration of the first renovation from the duration of the second renovation.
   - Duration of the second renovation: 2 years
   - Duration of the first renovation: 1 year
   - Difference: 2 years - 1 year = 1 year

Therefore, the second renovation was 1 year longer than the first renovation at the Birmingham–Jefferson Convention Complex.

","To find out how many years longer the time between the fourth and fifth editions was than between the first and second editions, let's break down the information provided in the table.

1. **First edition:** 1995
2. **Second edition:** 1996
3. **Fourth edition:** 2007
4. **Fifth edition:** 2015

Now, let's calculate the time gaps:

- **Time between the first and second editions:** 1996 - 1995 = 1 year
- **Time between the fourth and fifth editions:** 2015 - 2007 = 8 years

Next, we compare these two time gaps to find out how many years longer the time between the fourth and fifth editions was:

8 years (fourth to fifth edition) - 1 year (first to second edition) = 7 years

Therefore, the time between the fourth and fifth editions was 7 years longer than the time between the first and second editions.

How many years longer was the time between the withdrawal of the B-24 Skua from the front line and its withdrawal from other duties than the time between its first flight and introduction?,3,aircraft,226,<num_years>,years,head,"category

B-24 Skua
Role	Carrier-based dive bomber/fighter | Type of aircraft
Manufacturer	Blackburn Aircraft
First flight	9 February 1937

Primary user	Fleet Air Arm
Number built	192
Variants	Blackburn Roc
['15 Blackburn Skua, Bristol Perseus (15650612347).jpg', 'Blackburn Skua in flight']

","To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps:

1. **Find the time between the withdrawal of the B-24 Skua from the front line and its withdrawal from other duties:**
   - The B-24 Skua was withdrawn from the front line in 1941.
   - It was withdrawn from other duties in March 1945.
   - Therefore, the time between these two events is 1945 - 1941 = 4 years.

2. **Find the time between its first flight and introduction:**
   - The first flight of the B-24 Skua was on 9 February 1937.
   - It was introduced in November 1938.
   - Therefore, the time between these two events is approximately 1 year and 9 months. Since we're comparing in years, we can approximate this to 2 years for simplicity, but for accuracy in comparison, we'll keep it as 1.75 years (since 9 months is roughly 0.75 years).

3. **Calculate the difference in years:**
   - The difference between the two periods is 4 years - 1.75 years = 2.25 years.

Therefore, the time between the withdrawal of the B-"

Civilian casualties | 1,650,000 dead

","To determine how many years longer Italy and the Axis belligerents were involved than Hungary, we need to look at the duration of each country's involvement in the conflict.

1. **Identify the years of involvement for Italy and Hungary:**
   - Italy was involved from 1940 to 1945, which means it was part of the Axis powers for the entire duration of the Western Front conflict, but specifically, its involvement as Fascist Italy (1922-1943) and then as the Italian Social Republic (1943-1945) indicates it was involved for approximately 5 years.
   - Hungary's involvement is stated as being from 1944 to 1945, which is approximately 1 year.

2. **Calculate the difference in years of involvement:**
   - Italy's involvement: 5 years
   - Hungary's involvement: 1 year
   - Difference: 5 years - 1 year = 4 years

Therefore, Italy and the Axis belligerents (specifically considering Italy's duration as a representative) were involved 4 years longer than Hungary.

","To find out how many years old the Palace of Westminster is, we need to consider its original construction year and the current year.

1. **Original Construction Year**: The table mentions that the Palace of Westminster was built in 1016. However, it also mentions that it was demolished in 1834 due to a fire and then rebuilt between 1840-1876. For the purpose of calculating its age, we consider the year of the original construction as the starting point because the question does not specify whether it's asking for the age of the current structure or the original one. Given the context, it seems to be asking for the age since the first construction.

2. **Current Year**: The problem statement does not specify a current year, but it mentions that the knowledge cutoff is December 2022. Therefore, we will use 2022 as the current year for our calculation.

3. **Calculate the Age**: To calculate the age of the Palace of Westminster, we subtract the year it was built from the current year.
   
   Age = Current Year - Year Built
   Age = 2022 - 1016
   Age = 1006 years

Therefore, as of 2022, the Palace of Westminster is 1006 years old"

","To find out how many years old the constitution was when the 2021 Myanmar protests aimed to abolish it, let's follow these steps:

1. Identify the year the constitution was established.
2. Identify the year the protests started.
3. Calculate the difference between the two years to find out how old the constitution was at the time of the protests.

From the table, we can see that the protests aimed to abolish the ""2008 Constitution"". This means the constitution was established in 2008.

The protests started in 2021, as indicated by the ""2021 Myanmar protests"".

Now, let's calculate the age of the constitution at the time of the protests:
2021 (year of the protests) - 2008 (year the constitution was established) = 13 years.

Therefore, the constitution was 13 years old when the 2021 Myanmar protests aimed to abolish it.

2. **Identify the year of the film in which Blitzen was Rudolph's father**: The table mentions that in the 1998 film, Blitzen was Rudolph's father. So, the year of this film is 1998.

3. **Calculate the number of years between these two events**: To find out how many years passed between the end of the Billie Mae Richards TV specials (2010) and the film where Blitzen was Rudolph's father (1998), we subtract the earlier year from the later year.
   
   Years passed = 2010 - 1998 = 12 years

Therefore, 12 years passed between the end of the Billie Mae Richards TV specials and the film in which Blitzen was Rudolph's father.

","To find out how many years passed between the first flight and the introduction of the JF-17 Thunder, we need to calculate the difference between the two dates given in the table.

1. The first flight of the JF-17 Thunder took place on 25 August 2003.
2. The introduction of the JF-17 Thunder occurred on 12 March 2007.

Now, let's calculate the difference:

- The first flight was in August 2003.
- The introduction was in March 2007.

From August 2003 to August 2007 is approximately 4 years. However, since the introduction happened in March 2007, which is before August 2007, we need to subtract a few months from the 4-year mark.

Given that a year has 12 months, 4 years would have 48 months. From August to March is 7 months (including March, and counting August as the first of the 12 months in the year it starts). So, if we subtract these 7 months from the 48 months (4 years), we get:

48 months - 7 months = 41 months

Since there are approximately 12 months in a year, we can convert 41 months into years"

","To find out how many years passed between the time INS Trishul was ordered and it was laid down, we need to look at the dates provided in the table for these two events.

1. **Ordered Date**: The INS Trishul was ordered on 17 November 1997.
2. **Laid Down Date**: It was laid down on 24 September 1999.

Now, let's calculate the time difference:

- From 17 November 1997 to 31 December 1997, it is approximately 1.5 months (since November has 30 days, 17 days remain in the month).
- Then, for the year 1998, it is a full year.
- From 1 January 1999 to 24 September 1999, it is approximately 9 months.

So, adding these together: 
- The remainder of 1997 (about 1.5 months),
- The full year of 1998,
- And about 9 months into 1999.

This totals to about 1 year and 10.5 months. However, since the question seems to be asking for the number of years (and given the format of possible answers, it's likely looking for a whole number), we"

","To find out how many years prior to Agustin I's rule the Plan of Iguala was, we need to establish when Agustin I's rule started and when the Plan of Iguala occurred.

1. **Identify the start of Agustin I's rule**: The table does not directly mention when Agustin I started his rule, but it does mention his abdication, which was on ""19 March 1823"". Given that José Manuel de Herrera is listed as the emperor for ""1822-1823"", it implies Agustin I's rule was before this period, likely starting in 1821 after Mexico's independence, as he is known historically as the first emperor of Mexico.

2. **Identify the date of the Plan of Iguala**: According to the table, the Plan of Iguala occurred on ""24 February 1821"".

3. **Calculate the difference**: Since Agustin I's rule effectively started after the Plan of Iguala in 1821 and considering he abdicated in 1823, the Plan of Iguala happened at the beginning of his rule, not years prior in the sense of completing full years before he started ruling.

","To determine the total number of years Aslam Watanjar was Minister of Defense, we need to look at the two separate periods he held this office.

1. The first period was from April to 28 July 1979. This is less than a full year, specifically approximately 4 months.
2. The second period was from 6 March 1990 to April 1992. This period spans approximately 2 years and 1 month.

Now, let's add these periods together:
- The first period is about 4 months, which is less than a year.
- The second period is approximately 2 years.

Since the first period is a fraction of a year and does not add up to a full year, we consider it as part of the total time but acknowledge that in terms of full years, Aslam Watanjar served as Minister of Defense for approximately 2 full years, with an additional fraction of a year from the first term.

Therefore, the total time Aslam Watanjar was Minister of Defense is approximately 2 years and 4 months. However, the question seems to be asking for the number of years, which would be around 2 full years, considering the fractional part as additional time served but not a full year.

- His coaching career relevant to the period since 1946 lasted from 1951 to 1956 (5 years), but since it overlaps with his playing career, we don't add the years linearly for the overlap.

","To determine the number of years Derrick Summers's playing career spanned, we need to look at the earliest and latest years mentioned in his career history.

1. **Earliest Year**: The earliest year mentioned in his career history is 2010, when he went undrafted. However, his first playing year is actually 2011, as mentioned in the career history section with the Jacksonville Sharks.

2. **Latest Year**: The latest year mentioned in his career history is 2019, with the Columbus Destroyers.

- **Earliest Playing Year**: 2011
- **Latest Playing Year**: 2019

**Calculation**: 2019 - 2011 + 1 = 9

Therefore, Derrick Summers's playing career spanned 9 years.

","To find out how many years Mohammad-Ali Foroughi was a member of the Parliament of Iran, we need to look at the duration of his membership as stated in the table.

The table mentions that he was a member of the Parliament of Iran from 19 November 1909 to 3 August 1921.

- Start date: 19 November 1909
- End date: 3 August 1921

The difference between these two dates is approximately 11 years and 8 months.

Since the question asks for the number of years, we can approximate this to 11 years, considering that the exact duration includes an additional 8 months, but for simplicity in answering, we focus on the full years served.

","To find out how many years the Coordination Center for Ethnic Germans was operational from 1937, we need to look at the information provided in the table regarding when it was formed and when it was dissolved.

1. **Formation Year**: The table states that the Coordination Center for Ethnic Germans was formed circa 1937. This means we take 1937 as the starting year.

2. **Dissolution Year**: According to the table, the agency was dissolved on May 8, 1945. This gives us the end year as 1945.

3. **Calculate Operational Years**: To find out how many years the agency was operational, we subtract the formation year from the dissolution year.
   
   Operational Years = Dissolution Year - Formation Year
   Operational Years = 1945 - 1937
   Operational Years = 8

So, the Coordination Center for Ethnic Germans was operational for 8 years from 1937.

","To find the number of years between Mišić's ordination and consecration, we need to calculate the difference between the dates of these two events.

1. **Ordination Date**: Mišić was ordained on 7 July 1882.
2. **Consecration Date**: According to the information provided under ""Consecration"" in the table, Mišić was consecrated on 18 June 1912. However, under ""Ordination history,"" there's a mention of an episcopal consecration date as 18 June 1892. Given the context and the rest of the information, the 1892 date seems to be an error or misplaced information because the main section of the table mentions 1912 as the year of consecration, which aligns with the sequence of events (ordination in 1882, and then a period of service before becoming a bishop). Therefore, we will use 18 June 1912, as the correct date of consecration.

Now, let's calculate the difference:

- **Ordination Year**: 1882
- **Consecration Year**: 1912

The difference between 1912 and 1882 is 30 years.

However, since we are considering all competitions, her first gold could also be this one, but we should check if there's an earlier one mentioned, which there isn't. So, 1980 is the year of her first gold medal.

2. **Identify the last gold medal year**: Looking at the information provided, after 1980, Pettersen won gold medals in 1982 (Oslo, 4 × 5 km relay) and 1984 (Sarajevo, 4 × 5 km relay). There's no mention of her winning a gold medal after 1984. Thus, 1984 is the year of her last gold medal mentioned in the table.

3. **Calculate the years between the first and last gold medals**: 
   - First gold medal year: 1980
   - Last gold medal year"

","To find out how many years were between the establishment of the first ceasefire and the eruption of a wider conflict, we need to follow these steps:

1. Identify the year when the first ceasefire was established.
2. Identify the year when a wider conflict erupted.
3. Calculate the difference between these two years to find out how many years were in between.

From the information provided in the table:

- The first ceasefire was established in September 2011.
- A wider conflict erupted in 2016.

Now, let's calculate the difference:

2016 (year of the wider conflict) - 2011 (year of the first ceasefire) = 5 years

Therefore, there were 5 years between the establishment of the first ceasefire and the eruption of a wider conflict.

","To find the number of years between the first edition of Atlantis and the 30th Anniversary Edition, we need to follow these steps:

1. Identify the publication year of the first edition.
2. Identify the publication year of the 30th Anniversary Edition.
3. Subtract the publication year of the first edition from the publication year of the 30th Anniversary Edition to find the difference in years.

From the given table, we can see that:
- The first edition was published in 1984.
- The 30th Anniversary Edition was published in 2019.

Now, let's calculate the difference:
2019 (30th Anniversary Edition) - 1984 (first edition) = 35 years.

However, the question asks for the years between the editions, not including the first edition's year but leading up to the 30th Anniversary Edition. Since the first edition was in 1984 and the 30th Anniversary Edition was in 2019, the calculation directly gives us the span of years from the first edition to the 30th Anniversary Edition, which includes 35 years.

","To find out how many years were between the time Stéphane Antiga first played professionally and when he began coaching, let's break down the information provided.

1. **First Professional Play**: According to the ""Career"" section, Antiga started playing professionally in 1994 with Paris UC.

2. **Start of Coaching Career**: The ""Previous teams coached"" section indicates that Antiga's first coaching stint was with Poland from 2014-2016. This implies he started coaching in 2014.

3. **Calculating the Gap**: To find the number of years between the start of his professional playing career and the start of his coaching career, we subtract the year he started playing from the year he started coaching.
   
   - Year started playing: 1994
   - Year started coaching: 2014
   
   - Gap = 2014 - 1994 = 20 years

","To determine the number of years between Carolijn Brouwer competing for the Netherlands and Belgium, we need to examine the information provided in the table regarding her sailing career and the events she participated in representing each country.

1. **Identify the events and years for the Netherlands**: The table mentions that representing the Netherlands, Carolijn Brouwer won a gold medal at the 1991 ISAF World Youth Championships in Laser Radial. It also mentions a silver medal at the 2007 World Championships in Tornado.

2. **Identify the events and years for Belgium**: The table does not specify particular years or events for Carolijn Brouwer representing Belgium. It only indicates that she represented Belgium, without providing details on the events or the years she participated in.

Given the lack of specific information about the years Carolijn Brouwer competed for Belgium, we cannot directly calculate the number of years between her competing for the Netherlands and Belgium based on the provided table. The table does not offer enough detail to determine when she started or stopped representing either country, making it impossible to calculate the gap or transition period between her representations.

","To find the number of years between Jager's gold medals at the Los Angeles Olympics and his gold medals at the Edmonton Pan Pacific Games (not Pan Am Games, as the gold medals mentioned for Edmonton are from the Pan Pacific Games), let's break down the information:

1. **Los Angeles Olympics**: Tom Jager won gold medals in 1984.
2. **Edmonton Pan Pacific Games**: Tom Jager won gold medals in 1991.

Now, calculate the difference in years between these two events:

1991 (Edmonton Pan Pacific Games) - 1984 (Los Angeles Olympics) = 7 years

However, the question seems to contain a mistake by referencing ""Edmonton Pan Am Games"" instead of ""Edmonton Pan Pacific Games"" for the context of Tom Jager's gold medals. If we were to consider the actual ""Pan American Games"" mentioned in the table, which took place in Mar del Plata in 1995, the calculation would be different:

","To find the number of years between Nicki Minaj's relationships with Safaree Samuels and Meek Mill, let's break down the information given:

1. Nicki Minaj was in a relationship with Safaree Samuels from 2000 to 2014. This means her relationship with him ended in 2014.
2. She was in a relationship with Meek Mill from 2015 to 2017. This means her relationship with him started in 2015.

Given this information, we can calculate the gap between the two relationships as follows:

1. **Independence from Russia**: The date given is 25 March 1918.
2. **Independence from USSR**: The date given is 25 August 1991.

Now, let's calculate the difference in years between these two dates:

","To find the number of years between the end of the last monarch's reign and the establishment of Denmark-Norway, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Identify the end year of the last monarch's reign**: According to the table, the last monarch, Christian II, ruled from 1513 to 1523. Therefore, the end year of his reign is 1523.

2. **Identify the year Denmark-Norway was established**: The table states that Denmark-Norway was established in 1537.

3. **Calculate the difference between the two years**: To find out how many years were between the end of Christian II's reign and the establishment of Denmark-Norway, we subtract the end year of his reign from the year Denmark-Norway was established. So, 1537 - 1523 = 14 years.

","To find the number of years between the first flight of the X-15 and when it was retired, let's break down the information provided:

1. The first flight of the X-15 occurred on 8 June 1959.
2. The X-15 was retired in December 1968.

Now, let's calculate the difference in years between these two dates:

- The year of the first flight is 1959.
- The year of retirement is 1968.

To find the number of years between these dates, we subtract the earlier year from the later year:

1968 - 1959 = 9 years

This indicates his direct NBA involvement was for approximately 2 years. However, considering the broader context of his professional career, which is often what such questions imply when not strictly defining ""NBA career,"" we see he was a professional from 1976 to 1989, totaling 13 years.

","To determine how much longer 20th Century Studios was owned by News Corporation than by 21st Century Fox, we need to calculate the duration of ownership for each company.

1. **News Corporation Ownership**: News Corporation owned 20th Century Studios from 1985 to 2013. The difference between these years is 2013 - 1985 = 28 years.

2. **21st Century Fox Ownership**: 21st Century Fox owned 20th Century Studios from 2013 to 2019. The difference between these years is 2019 - 2013 = 6 years.

3. **Calculating the Difference in Ownership Duration**: To find out how much longer News Corporation owned 20th Century Studios compared to 21st Century Fox, we subtract the duration of 21st Century Fox's ownership from that of News Corporation. So, 28 years (News Corporation) - 6 years (21st Century Fox) = 22 years.

Therefore, News Corporation owned 20th Century Studios for 22 years longer than 21st Century Fox.

1. **Birth Year and Starting Skating Year**: According to the table, Max Aaron was born on February 25, 1992, and he began skating in 1996.

2. **Calculate Age**: To calculate his age when he started skating, we subtract his birth year from the year he started skating. However, since we're looking for his age, we simply look at the difference in years and consider if his birthday had passed or not at the time.

   - Started skating in 1996

","To determine how old Alicia Coutts was when she won her first gold medal at the Pan Pacific Championships in 2014, let's break down the information provided.

1. **Alicia Coutts' Birthdate**: Alicia Coutts was born on September 14, 1987.
2. **Year of the Event**: The Pan Pacific Championships where she won her first gold medals took place in 2014.
3. **Calculating Age**: To find out how old she was in 2014, we subtract her birth year from the year of the event: 2014 - 1987 = 27 years.
4. **Considering the Month of the Event**: The Pan Pacific Championships took place on the Gold Coast in 2014, but the exact date is not provided in the table. However, given that Alicia Coutts' birthday is in September, if the championships occurred before September 2014, she would have been 26 years old at the time of the event. If they occurred in September or later, she would have been 27 years old.

Given the information typically available and without the exact dates of the 2014 Pan Pacific Championships, we can estimate her age based on the assumption that the event likely took place before her birthday"

1. Determine the year Alimuddin Zumla won the prize: According to the table, he won the EU-EDCTP Pascoal Mocumbi Prize in 2021.

2. Determine Alimuddin Zumla's birth year: The table states he was born on 15 May 1955.

3. Calculate Alimuddin Zumla's age in 2021: To do this, subtract his birth year from the year he won the prize. 
   - 2021 (year of the prize) - 1955 (birth year) = 66 years.

However, since the prize was awarded in 2021 and we do not have the exact date of the award, we should consider if his birthday had passed in 2021 before the award. Given that his birthday is on May 15, and assuming the award was given after this date (since the exact date of the award is not specified), Alimuddin Zumla would have been 66 years old when he won the prize.

","To find out how old Ambrose Rayappan was when he became Archbishop Emeritus of Pondicherry and Cuddalore, we need to determine the date he became Archbishop Emeritus and then calculate his age at that time based on his birthdate.

1. **Determine the date Ambrose Rayappan became Archbishop Emeritus**: The table does not directly provide the date when Ambrose Rayappan became Archbishop Emeritus. However, it mentions his term as Archbishop ended on ""17 March 1973."" Typically, becoming an ""Emeritus"" follows the end of one's term in such positions, so we can infer that he likely became Archbishop Emeritus after this date.

2. **Calculate Ambrose Rayappan's age**: Given that Ambrose Rayappan was born on ""25 February 1901"" and assuming he became Archbishop Emeritus immediately after his term ended on ""17 March 1973,"" we calculate his age as follows:
   - Birth year: 1901
   - Year of becoming Archbishop Emeritus: 1973
   - Age = 1973 - 1901 = 72 years
   - Since his birthday (February 25) is before the date he became Archbishop Emeritus (March 17),"

So, she started playing for CSM București in 2021.

Next, we look at her birthdate, which is 1 January 1994. 

Given that her age is calculated as of December 2022, when she started playing for CSM București in 2021, we calculate her age as follows:
- Birth year: 1994

","To find out how old Art Carney was when he first got divorced, we need to follow these steps:

1. Identify the year Art Carney first got divorced.
2. Identify Art Carney's birth year.
3. Calculate the age by subtracting the birth year from the year of the first divorce.

From the table, we see that Art Carney was married to Jean Myers from 1940 and divorced in 1965. This is the first divorce mentioned.

Art Carney was born on November 4, 1918.

Now, let's calculate his age at the time of his first divorce:
- Year of first divorce: 1965
- Birth year: 1918
- Age at first divorce = 1965 - 1918 = 47

Since his birthday is in November and the divorce is mentioned without a specific date, if the divorce happened before November 1965, he would have been 46 at the time of divorce. However, given the information provided, we calculate his age as of the end of 1965.

2. **Identify the year of his MLB debut**: The table states that Art Wilson made his MLB debut on September 29, 1908.
3. **Calculate the age at debut**: To find out how old he was at the time of his debut, we subtract his birth year from the year of his debut: 1908 - 1885 = 23.
4. **Consider the date of birth and debut**: Since his birthday (December 11) is after the date of his debut (September 29) in the same year, we do not need to add 1 to the calculated age.

Therefore, when Art Wilson made his MLB debut on September 29, 1908, he was 22 years old.

","To find out how old Aruna Quadri was when he reached the number 10 ranking, we need to determine the date when this ranking was achieved and then calculate his age at that time based on his birthdate.

1. **Identify the date Aruna Quadri reached number 10 ranking**: According to the table, Aruna Quadri reached his highest ranking of 10 in May 2022.

2. **Identify Aruna Quadri's birthdate**: His birthdate is given as 9 August 1988.

However, since his birthday is in August and the ranking was achieved in May, we need to consider if he had his birthday before May. Since May comes before August, at the time of reaching the number 10 ranking in May 2022, he was still 33 years old, as he hadn't had his birthday for that year yet.

Therefore, when Aruna Quadri reached the number 10 ranking in May 2022, he was 33 years old.

2. 6 March 1990 - April 1992

We know Aslam Watanjar was born in 1946.

For the first period (April - 28 July 1979), if we assume he took office at the beginning of April 1979, we can estimate his age:
- Born in 1946
- Took office in 1979
- Age in 1979 = 1979 - 1946 = 33 years old

For the second period (6 March 1990 - April 1992), calculating his age when he took office on 6 March 1990:
- Born in 1946
- Took office on 6 March 1990
- Age on 6 March 1990 = 1990 - 1946 = 44 years old

Therefore, when Aslam Watanjar took office as the Minister of Defence, he was 33 years old during his first term and 44 years old during his second term.

","To find out how old Blaze Riorden was when he won the America East Defensive Player of the Year in 2016, let's break down the information provided.

1. **Identify the year the award was won**: The year Blaze Riorden won the America East Defensive Player of the Year award is given as 2016.

2. **Identify Blaze Riorden's birthdate**: His birthdate is given as February 13, 1994.

3. **Calculate his age in 2016**: To find out how old he was in 2016 when he won the award, we subtract his birth year from the year he won the award and then consider the month and day.

   - Birth year: 1994
   - Year of the award: 2016
   - Age at the end of 2016: 2016 - 1994 = 22 years

   Since his birthday is on February 13, and assuming the award was given at the end of the year or after his birthday in 2016, he would have been 22 years old when he received the award.

","To answer the question, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Identify the relevant information**: We need to find out when Carolijn Brouwer won her last gold medal in the World Championships and her age at that time.

2. **Examine the table for gold medals in World Championships**: The table mentions her winning a gold medal, but specifically under the ""ISAF World Youth Championships"" section, not the ""World Championships"" section. The gold medal mentioned is from 1991 in the Laser Radial class.

3. **Check for any gold medals in the World Championships section**: The ""World Championships"" section only mentions a silver medal won in 2007 in the Tornado class, with no mention of a gold medal.

4. **Conclusion based on available information**: Since there's no mention of Carolijn Brouwer winning a gold medal in the World Championships, but rather in the ISAF World Youth Championships, we can infer the question might be slightly misleading or based on incomplete information provided in the table.

","To determine how old Cody Ware was when he debuted in the NASCAR Cup Series, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Identify the year Cody Ware debuted in the NASCAR Cup Series**: According to the table, his first race in the NASCAR Cup Series was the ""2017 Folds of Honor QuikTrip 500 (Atlanta)"".

2. **Identify Cody Ware's birth year**: The table states Cody Ware was born on ""November 7, 1995"".

3. **Calculate Cody Ware's age at the time of his debut**: Since his debut was in 2017 and he was born in 1995, we subtract his birth year from the debut year to find his age. However, because his birthday is in November and his debut was presumably earlier in the year (the specific date of the ""2017 Folds of Honor QuikTrip 500"" is not provided but typically such races occur before November), we need to consider if he had his birthday before the race.

Given the information:
- Birth year: 1995
- Debut year: 2017
- Age at the end of 2021: 26 (as per the table, indicating he was 26 years old by November 2021)

","To find out how old Daria Timoshenko was when she began skating, we need to subtract the year she began skating from her birth year and then consider the time of year she was born and started skating.

1. Daria Timoshenko was born on August 1, 1980.
2. She began skating in 1985.

Since she was born in August, when calculating her age at the start of skating, we should consider that she would have been a certain age at the beginning of the year and then turned older later in the year.

- Born in August 1980
- Started skating in 1985

If we subtract the birth year from the year she started skating:
1985 - 1980 = 5 years

Given that she started skating in 1985 and was born in August 1980, at the beginning of 1985, she would have been 4 years old, and by August 1985, she would have turned 5 years old.

Therefore, when Daria Timoshenko began skating in 1985, she was 4 years old, as she would not have turned 5 until August of that year.

","To determine how old Dario Franchitti was when he won the BRDC Gold Star in 2009, we need to follow these steps:

1. Identify Dario Franchitti's birth year and date.
2. Calculate his age in 2009 based on his birth year and date.

From the given table, Dario Franchitti's birthdate is May 19, 1973.

Next, we calculate his age in 2009:
- Dario was born in 1973.
- The year we are interested in is 2009.
- So, his age in 2009 would be 2009 - 1973 = 36 years old.

Since his birthday is on May 19, and we do not have the exact date of when he won the BRDC Gold Star in 2009, we can say he was either 35 or 36 years old when he received the award, depending on whether the award was given before or after his birthday in 2009.

However, considering the general practice of awarding such honors, it's likely the award was given at the end of the year or after his birthday, making him 36 years old at the time of receiving the award.

1. Identify Dennis Erickson's birthdate: According to the table, Dennis Erickson was born on March 24, 1947.
2. Calculate his age in 1985: To do this, we subtract his birth year from the year he won the championship and then consider the month and day to accurately determine his age at the time of the championship.

Dennis Erickson's birth year: 1947
Year of the Big Sky Championship: 1985

Age at the end of 1985 = 1985 - 1947 = 38 years

Since his birthday is on March 24, and the championship would have occurred before or by the end of the 1985 calendar year, we need to consider if he had his birthday before or after winning the championship. Given that football championships typically occur at the end of the year, it's likely he had already had his 38th birthday by the time he won the championship.

Therefore, when Dennis Erickson won the Big Sky Championship in 1985, he was 38 years old.

","To find out how old Derrell Palmer was when he entered the NFL draft, we need to know his birth year and the year he was drafted.

1. **Birth Year**: According to the table, Derrell Palmer was born on August 27, 1922.
2. **Draft Year**: The table also states that he was part of the 1943 NFL Draft.

Now, let's calculate his age at the time of the draft:

- **Birth Year**: 1922
- **Draft Year**: 1943
- **Age at Draft**: 1943 - 1922 = 21 years old

Since his birthday is in August and the NFL draft typically occurs in the spring or early summer (though the exact date can vary and has changed over the years), if the draft happened before August 27, 1943, he would have been 20 years old at the time of the draft.

","To find out how old Derrell Palmer was when he was inducted into the TCU Hall of Fame in 1978, we need to follow these steps:

1. Identify the year Derrell Palmer was born: According to the table, Derrell Palmer was born on August 27, 1922.
2. Identify the year Derrell Palmer was inducted into the TCU Hall of Fame: The table states this happened in 1978.
3. Calculate the age of Derrell Palmer at the time of induction: To do this, subtract the year of birth from the year of induction.

Since the specific date of induction is not provided, we will assume it happened after August 27, 1978, to provide the age as of the end of that year.

Age calculation: 1978 - 1922 = 56

Since Derrell Palmer's birthday is on August 27, and assuming the induction happened after this date in 1978, he would have already turned 56 by the time of the induction.

2. Determine his age at that time.

From the table, under ""National team"", it is mentioned that Draško Nenadić started playing for the Serbia national team in 2012.

Next, we find his birthdate, which is 15 February 1990.

So, when he started playing for the national team in 2012, we calculate his age as follows:
- He was born in 1990.
- He started playing for the national team in 2012.
- Therefore, his age in 2012 would be 2012 - 1990 = 22 years old.

1. Identify the year Emmitt Smith graduated from college.
2. Identify Emmitt Smith's birth year.
3. Calculate the age based on the graduation year and birth year.

From the table provided:
- Emmitt Smith attended college from 1987 to 1989.
- Assuming he graduated after the 1989 academic year, we can infer his graduation year as 1989.
- Emmitt Smith was born on May 15, 1969.

Given that his birth year is 1969 and his graduation year is 1989, we calculate his age at graduation as follows:
- Graduation year: 1989
- Birth year: 1969
- Age at graduation = Graduation year - Birth year = 1989 - 1969 = 20 years

Since Emmitt Smith's birthday is in May, and assuming the graduation typically occurs at the end of the spring semester (around May or June), he would have been 20 years old when he graduated.

","To determine how old Emmitt Smith was when he last played in the Pro Bowl, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Find the year of his last Pro Bowl appearance**: According to the table, Emmitt Smith's Pro Bowl appearances were in the years 1990-1995, 1998, and 1999. Therefore, his last Pro Bowl appearance was in 1999.

2. **Determine Emmitt Smith's birth year**: The table states that Emmitt Smith was born on May 15, 1969.

3. **Calculate his age at the time of his last Pro Bowl**: Since his last Pro Bowl was in 1999 and he was born in 1969, we calculate his age as of 1999. 
    - 1999 - 1969 = 30 years old.

However, because his birthday is in May, we need to consider if the Pro Bowl, which typically takes place in late January or early February, occurred before or after his birthday in 1999.
    - If the Pro Bowl in 1999 happened before May 15, he would have been 29 years old at the time of the game.

","To find out how old Emmitt Smith was when he received the NFL Most Valuable Player Award in 1993, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine Emmitt Smith's birth year and month: According to the table, Emmitt Smith was born on May 15, 1969.
2. Calculate his age in 1993: Since he was born in 1969, in 1993 he would be 24 years old, as 1993 - 1969 = 24.
3. Consider the month of the award: The NFL Most Valuable Player Award for the 1992 season would typically be awarded in 1993, but the exact date of the award ceremony is not specified. However, given that Emmitt Smith's birthday is in May, if the award was given before May 1993, he would have been 23 years old at the time of the award. If it was given after May 1993, he would have been 24 years old.

Given the information and typical timing of such awards, it's reasonable to conclude that Emmitt Smith was likely 24 years old when he received the award, assuming the ceremony took place after his birthday in May. However, without the exact date of the"

","To determine how old Jeffrey Epstein was when he was apprehended, we need to follow these steps:

1. Identify the date of birth of Jeffrey Epstein.
2. Identify the date he was apprehended.
3. Calculate the age based on these two dates.

Step 1: According to the table, Jeffrey Epstein was born on January 20, 1953.

Step 2: The table states that he was apprehended on July 6, 2019.

Step 3: To calculate his age at the time of apprehension, we subtract his year of birth from the year of apprehension and then consider the months and days for a precise calculation.

- Year of apprehension: 2019
- Difference in years: 2019 - 1953 = 66 years

Since his birthday (January 20) had already passed by the time he was apprehended (July 6), he was indeed 66 years old at the time of his apprehension.

3. To find her age at the time of the competition, we subtract her birth year from the year of the competition: 2009 - 1986 = 23.

However, since we are calculating her age at the time of the event, which took place in 2009, and considering that her birthday is on May 3, we should also account for whether the event occurred before or after her birthday in 2009. The IPC Alpine Skiing World Championships in 2009 took place in Pyeongchang, but the exact dates are not provided in the table. However, given that the championships typically occur in the early part of the year, it's likely that the event happened before May 3, 2009.

Given this, Henrieta Farkašová would have been 22 years old during the 2009 IPC Alpine"

1. **Identify the year Hewitt played for the Chicago Bulls**: According to the table, Hewitt played for the Chicago Bulls in 1974.

2. **Identify Hewitt's birth year**: Hewitt was born on August 8, 1944.

2. Identify the year Hulk Hogan married Linda Hogan: The table states that Hulk Hogan married Linda Hogan in 1983.

Marriage year: 1983

Age at marriage = 1983 - 1953 = 30 years

Since Hulk Hogan was born in August and married in a year that is not specified by month, we can say he was 29 years old when he married in 1983 if the marriage occurred before August, or 30 years old if it occurred after August.

","To find out how old Marja-Liisa Kirvesniemi was when she won her first gold medal at the 1978 World Championships, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the birth year of Marja-Liisa Kirvesniemi.
2. Calculate her age in 1978.

From the table, we find that Marja-Liisa Kirvesniemi was born on September 10, 1955.

Now, let's calculate her age in 1978:
- Birth year: 1955
- Year of the first gold medal: 1978
- Age in 1978 = 1978 - 1955 = 23

Since her birthday is in September, and assuming the World Championships took place before her birthday in 1978, she would have been 22 years old when she won her first gold medal. If the championships occurred after her birthday, she would have been 23. However, given the typical timing of the World Championships and without the exact date of the event, the most accurate answer based on the information provided would lean towards her being 22 years old, considering the championships likely took place before September 10, 1978.

","To determine how old Michael Owen was when he joined Real Madrid, we need to follow these steps:

1. Identify the year Michael Owen joined Real Madrid. According to the table, he joined Real Madrid from 2004-2005.

2. Identify Michael Owen's date of birth. The table states he was born on 14 December 1979.

3. Calculate Michael Owen's age when he joined Real Madrid. Since he joined in 2004, we consider the year 2004 for the calculation. 

Michael Owen was born in 1979, so in 2004, he would be 25 years old (2004 - 1979 = 25). However, because his birthday is on December 14, and assuming he joined Real Madrid at the beginning of the 2004-2005 season (which typically starts in August for European football leagues), he would still be 24 years old when he joined, as his 25th birthday would not have occurred yet.

3. **Calculate his age at the time of taking office**: Since he took office in 1913 and was born in 1877, we subtract the birth year from the year he took office to find his age. However, because his birth month is August and he took office in June, we need to consider if he had his birthday before taking office. Given that his birthday is after the date he took office (June 3, 1913), we calculate his age as follows: 1913 - 1877 = 36 years old. Since his birthday in August 1913 would come after he took office, at the time of taking office, he was still 35 years old.

Last updated on: 13 June 2022.

","To determine how old Novak Djokovic was when he competed in the Olympic Games, we first need to identify the years he participated in the Olympics based on the information provided in the table.

1. **Identify Olympic Participation Years**: According to the table, Novak Djokovic participated in the Olympic Games in 2008 and 2016 for singles and doubles, and in 2020 for mixed doubles.

2. **Determine Birth Year and Calculate Age**: Novak Djokovic was born on May 22, 1987.

3. **Calculate Age for Each Olympic Year**:
   - For the 2008 Olympics, Novak would have been 21 years old (since his birthday is in May, and the Olympics typically take place in July/August, he would have already had his birthday that year).
   - For the 2016 Olympics, Novak would have been 29 years old.
   - For the 2020 Olympics, considering the event was held in 2021 due to the pandemic, Novak would have been 34 years old.

Given the question does not specify which Olympic Games, the most direct answer based on the first instance of Olympic participation mentioned would be when he was 21 years old.

","To find out how old Michael Owen was when he began his senior career, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the year Michael Owen began his senior career.
2. Calculate his age at that time based on his birthdate.

From the table, under ""Senior career*"", it's mentioned that his senior career started in ""1996-2004"" with Liverpool. This means he began his senior career in 1996.

Next, we find his birthdate: 14 December 1979.

Now, we calculate his age in 1996:
- Michael Owen was born in 1979.
- His senior career started in 1996.
- So, in 1996, he was 16 years old (since his birthday is in December, he would have been 16 by the end of 1996, but at the beginning of 1996, he was still 16, having turned 16 in December 1995).

Therefore, when Michael Owen began his senior career in 1996, he was 16 years old.

Born	April 7, 1908 | Toronto, Ontario, Canada
Died	February 9, 1976 | (1976-02-09) |  (aged 67) | Encino, California, U.S.
Occupation(s)	Bandleader, orchestrator, composer

","To find out how old Percy Faith was when he died, we need to calculate the difference between his year of death and his year of birth.

1. Percy Faith was born on April 7, 1908.
2. He died on February 9, 1976.
3. To calculate his age at the time of death, we subtract his birth year from his death year: 1976 - 1908 = 68.
4. However, since he died before his birthday in 1976 (his birthday is in April, and he died in February), we need to consider if he had already had his 68th birthday. Given that his birthday is on April 7 and he died on February 9, he had not yet turned 68 in the year he died.
5. Therefore, at the time of his death, Percy Faith was 67 years old.

","To find out how old Richard Caswell was when he got married, we need to look at the information provided about his marriages and his birthdate.

1. Richard Caswell's birthdate is given as August 3, 1729.
2. He was married twice: 
   - First marriage was to Mary Mackilwean in 1752.
   - Second marriage was to Sarah Herritage in 1758.

Given this information, we can calculate his age at the time of each marriage:

- For the first marriage in 1752: 
  - 1752 (year of marriage) - 1729 (year of birth) = 23 years old.
  
- For the second marriage in 1758:
  - 1758 (year of marriage) - 1729 (year of birth) = 29 years old.

Therefore, Richard Caswell was 23 years old when he got married for the first time and 29 years old when he got married for the second time.

1. Identify the year Richard Caswell married Sarah Herritage.
2. Identify the year Richard Caswell was born.
3. Calculate the difference between the year of marriage and the year of birth to find the age.

From the table, we can see that:
- Richard Caswell married Sarah Herritage in 1758.
- Richard Caswell was born on August 3, 1729.

Now, let's calculate his age at the time of marriage:
1758 (year of marriage) - 1729 (year of birth) = 29 years

Since the exact dates of birth and marriage are provided, but the question only asks for the age at the time of marriage, and given that his birthday is in August while the year of marriage is given without a specific date, we can reasonably assume he was 29 years old when he married, as his birthday would have already passed in August of that year or would pass later, still making him 29 for the entirety of 1758 after August.

","To find out how old Alessandro Riguccini was when he became active as a fighter, we need to look at two key pieces of information from the table:

1. His birthdate: 25 March 1988
2. The year he became active as a fighter: 1999

Now, let's calculate his age at the time he became active:

- Birth year: 1988
- Year he became active: 1999

The difference between these two years is 1999 - 1988 = 11 years.

So, when Alessandro Riguccini became active as a fighter in 1999, he was 11 years old.

","To find out how old Robby Gordon was when he first raced in the NASCAR Cup Series, we need to follow these steps:

1. Identify the year Robby Gordon first raced in the NASCAR Cup Series.
2. Identify Robby Gordon's birth year.
3. Calculate the age of Robby Gordon at the time of his first NASCAR Cup Series race.

Step 1: According to the table, Robby Gordon's first race in the NASCAR Cup Series was the ""1991 Daytona 500 (Daytona)"".

Step 2: Robby Gordon was born on ""January 2, 1969"".

Step 3: To calculate his age at the time of his first NASCAR Cup Series race, we subtract his birth year from the year of his first race: 1991 - 1969 = 22. However, since his birthday is on January 2 and the Daytona 500 typically takes place in February, we need to consider if he had his birthday before the race. Given that the Daytona 500 occurs after January 2, Robby Gordon would have been 22 years old at the time of the 1991 Daytona 500.

Final Answer: Robby Gordon was 22 years old when he first raced in the NASCAR Cup Series"

","To find out how old Roger Federer was when he won his first Olympic gold medal, we need to follow these steps:

1. Identify the year Roger Federer won his first Olympic gold medal.
2. Determine Roger Federer's birth year.
3. Calculate the age by subtracting the birth year from the year he won the gold medal.

From the table, under ""Other doubles tournaments"" and ""Olympic Games,"" it is mentioned that Roger Federer won a Gold medal in 2008.

Roger Federer's birthdate is given as 8 August 1981.

Since he won the gold medal in 2008, we subtract his birth year from this year to find his age: 2008 - 1981 = 27.

However, because his birthday is in August and the Olympics take place in the summer, we need to consider if he had his birthday before or after the Olympics in 2008. The 2008 Beijing Olympics took place from August 8 to August 24. Given that Roger Federer's birthday is on August 8, he would have turned 27 during the Olympics.

Therefore, when he won his first Olympic gold medal, Roger Federer was 26 years old, turning 27 during the event"

","To determine how old Roy Emerson was when he began to play professionally, we need to look at two key pieces of information from the table: his birthdate and the year he turned pro.

1. **Birthdate**: Roy Emerson was born on November 3, 1936.
2. **Year Turned Pro**: He turned pro in 1968.

Now, let's calculate his age at the time he turned pro:

- Birth year: 1936
- Year turned pro: 1968
- Age when turned pro = Year turned pro - Birth year = 1968 - 1936 = 32 years

So, when Roy Emerson began to play professionally in 1968, he was 32 years old, but it's also mentioned that he was on the amateur tour from 1953. However, the question specifically asks about when he turned pro.

1. Identify the year Roy Emerson first won the French Open Doubles.
2. Identify Roy Emerson's birth year.
3. Calculate the age by subtracting the birth year from the year of the first French Open Doubles win.

From the table, we can see that Roy Emerson first won the French Open Doubles in 1960.

Roy Emerson was born on November 3, 1936.

Now, let's calculate his age at the time of his first French Open Doubles win:
- Year of first win: 1960
- Birth year: 1936
- Age at first win = 1960 - 1936 = 24 years

Since his birthday is on November 3, and assuming the French Open takes place before November 3 (typically in late May and early June), when he won in 1960, he would have been 23 years old at the time of the tournament.

","To determine how old Ryan Hunter-Reay was when he won the Skip Barber National Championship in 1999, we need to calculate his age based on his birth year.

1. Ryan Hunter-Reay was born on December 17, 1980.
2. He won the Skip Barber National Championship in 1999.
3. To find his age in 1999, we subtract his birth year from the year he won the championship: 1999 - 1980 = 19.
4. However, since his birthday is in December, we need to consider whether he had his birthday before or after winning the championship. The exact date of the championship win is not provided, but given that his birthday is in December, if the win occurred before December 17, 1999, he would have been 18 years old at the time of the win. If it occurred on or after December 17, 1999, he would have been 19 years old.

Given the information provided, we cannot determine the exact date of the championship win. However, since the question asks for his age when he won the championship, and considering typical championship timelines, it's plausible that the win occurred before his birthday in 1999, making him 18 years old"

1. Identify the year Sam Snead turned professional: According to the table, Sam Snead turned professional in 1934.

2. Identify Sam Snead's birth year: Although the birth year is not directly provided, we can calculate it using the information about his death. Sam Snead died on May 23, 2002, at the age of 89. 

3. Calculate Sam Snead's birth year: If he died in 2002 at the age of 89, we subtract 89 from 2002 to find his birth year. So, 2002 - 89 = 1913.

4. Calculate Sam Snead's age when he turned professional: Now that we know he was born in 1913 and turned professional in 1934, we subtract his birth year from the year he turned professional to find his age. So, 1934 - 1913 = 21.

","To find out how old Stephen Hawking was when he died, we need to calculate the difference between his year of death and his year of birth.

1. **Identify the year of birth**: According to the table, Stephen Hawking was born on January 8, 1942.
2. **Identify the year of death**: The table states that Stephen Hawking died on March 14, 2018.
3. **Calculate the age at death**: Subtract the year of birth from the year of death to get the age. However, since we are calculating the age at the time of death, we should consider if he had his birthday before he died in that year. 
   - Year of death: 2018
   - Year of birth: 1942
   - Age at death = 2018 - 1942 = 76 years

Given that his birthday (January 8) is before his death date (March 14) in the same year, the calculated age is correct and does not need adjustment.

","To find out how old Steve Jobs was when he married Laurene Powell, we need to follow these steps:

1. Identify the year Steve Jobs married Laurene Powell.
2. Identify the birth year of Steve Jobs.
3. Calculate the age of Steve Jobs at the time of marriage by subtracting his birth year from the year he got married.

From the table, we can find the following information:
- Steve Jobs married Laurene Powell in 1991.
- Steve Jobs was born on February 24, 1955.

Now, let's calculate his age at the time of marriage:
- Year of marriage: 1991
- Year of birth: 1955
- Age at marriage = Year of marriage - Year of birth = 1991 - 1955 = 36

Since Steve Jobs was born in February and got married in the same year (considering the marriage happened after his birthday in 1991), we do not need to adjust the year for the calculation of age in this context.

","To find out how old Thomas Eakins was when he died, we need to subtract his birth year from his death year.

1. **Identify the birth and death years**: Thomas Eakins was born on July 25, 1844, and died on June 25, 1916.

2. **Calculate the age at death**: Subtract the birth year from the death year to get the age. 
   - Death year: 1916
   - Birth year: 1844
   - Age at death = Death year - Birth year = 1916 - 1844 = 72

However, since his birthday (July 25) had not yet occurred in the year of his death (he died on June 25), we need to consider if this affects his age calculation.

3. **Consider the birthdays**: 
   - Born on July 25, 1844
   - Died on June 25, 1916
   Since he died before his birthday in 1916, he was still 71 years old at the time of his death.

Therefore, when Thomas Eakins died, he was 71 years old.

","To find out how old Tony Stewart was when he won his first NASCAR Series race in 2002, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the date of his first NASCAR Series win.
2. Calculate his age at that time based on his birthdate.

From the table provided, under ""NASCAR Cup Series career,"" it's mentioned that his ""First win"" was in ""1999 Exide NASCAR Select Batteries 400 (Richmond),"" not in 2002. This indicates that 2002 was not the year of his first NASCAR Series win, but rather one of the years he won a championship.

However, since the question specifically asks about his first NASCAR Series win and mentions 2002, which seems to be an error given the information provided, we should clarify:

- His first NASCAR Cup Series win was in 1999.
- The first win mentioned for the NASCAR Camping World Truck Series was in 2002, at the ""Virginia Is For Lovers 200 (Richmond)"".

Given Tony Stewart's birthdate is May 20, 1971, if we consider the 1999 win as the basis for calculation (since it's his first mentioned NASCAR win, even though the question mistakenly references 2002):

Given that Aslam Watanjar was born in 1946, let's calculate his age for each period:

1. For the period April - 28 July 1979:
   - Since he was born in 1946, in 1979 he would be 33 years old.

2. For the period 6 March 1990 - April 1992:
   - In 1990, he would be 44 years old (since 1990 - 1946 = 44).

Therefore, when Aslam Watanjar took office as Minister of Defence, he was 33 years old during his first term and 44 years old during his second term.

Final Answer: He was 33 years old during his first term and 44 years old during his second term as Minister of Defence."

","To find out how old Babe Young was when he made his MLB debut, we need to calculate the difference between his birth year and the year of his debut, and then consider the months to get an accurate age.

1. **Identify Birth Date and Debut Date:**
   - Birth date: July 1, 1915
   - MLB debut date: September 26, 1936

2. **Calculate Age at Debut:**
   - Year difference: 1936 - 1915 = 21 years
   - Since his birthday (July 1) is before his debut date (September 26) in the same year, we don't need to adjust the year difference for this calculation.

3. **Conclusion:**
   - At the time of his MLB debut on September 26, 1936, Babe Young was 21 years old.

","To find out how old the church was when it was consecrated, we need to determine the year the church was originally founded and then subtract that from the year it was consecrated.

1. **Determine the founding year of the church**: According to the table, the church was ""Founded"" in the ""13th century"". Since the 13th century encompasses the years 1201 to 1300, we don't have an exact year, but we can use 1201 as the earliest possible founding year and 1300 as the latest for our calculation.

2. **Determine the consecration year**: The church was ""Consecrated"" on ""31 July 1949"".

3. **Calculate the age of the church at consecration**:
    - If we use the earliest possible founding year (1201), the calculation would be: 1949 - 1201 = 748 years.
    - If we use the latest possible founding year (1300), the calculation would be: 1949 - 1300 = 649 years.

Given the range of possible founding years within the 13th century, the church could have been between approximately 649 to 748 years old when it was consecrated in 1949.

Background information
Born	April 7, 1908 | Toronto, Ontario, Canada
Died	February 9, 1976 | (1976-02-09) |  (aged 67) | Encino, California, U.S.
Occupation(s)	Bandleader, orchestrator, composer

","To find out how old Percy Faith would have been if he had died three months later in 1976, let's break down the information step by step.

1. **Percy Faith's birthdate:** April 7, 1908
2. **Percy Faith's actual date of death:** February 9, 1976
3. **Calculating his age at the time of death:** 
   - Since he died in February 1976, we consider his age as of February 1976.
   - He was born in April 1908, so by February 1976, he had not yet had his 68th birthday.
   - Therefore, at the time of his death, Percy Faith was 67 years old.
4. **Calculating his age if he had died three months later:**
   - If he had died three months after February 9, 1976, that would be May 9, 1976.
   - By May 9, 1976, he would have had his 68th birthday on April 7, 1976.
   - Therefore, if Percy Faith had died three months later than he actually did, he would have been 68 years old.

","To determine how many years a judge can serve before a five-year extension is required, we need to understand the term length of a judge in the Supreme Court of Argentina.

1. **Judge Term Length**: According to the table, a judge's term length is until they are 75 years old. At that age, the President and the Senate can choose to keep the judges for an additional term of five years, following the same process as for their initial appointment.

2. **Age of Appointment**: The question states that the judge is appointed at the age of 50.

3. **Years Before Extension Required**: To find out how many years the judge can serve before a five-year extension is required, we subtract the age of appointment from the age at which an extension can be considered.
   
   - Age at which extension can be considered: 75 years
   - Age of appointment: 50 years
   - Years before extension required = 75 - 50 = 25 years

Therefore, a judge appointed at the age of 50 can serve for 25 years before a five-year extension is required.

","To determine the number of years Casey Mears participated in the NASCAR Xfinity Series, we need to look at the information provided in the table under the ""NASCAR Xfinity Series career"" section.

1. **First Race**: The first race mentioned for Casey Mears in the NASCAR Xfinity Series is the 2001 GNC Live Well 300 (Homestead).
2. **Last Race**: The last race mentioned for Casey Mears in the NASCAR Xfinity Series is the 2017 Ford EcoBoost 300 (Homestead).

Given this information, we can calculate the number of years he participated by subtracting the year of the first race from the year of the last race and then adding 1 (since we are counting the years inclusively).

- Year of the first race: 2001
- Year of the last race: 2017

","To determine the number of years Dwayne Johnson was an active wrestler, we need to look at the information provided in the table under ""Years active"" for wrestling.

1. The table states that Dwayne Johnson was active in wrestling from ""1996-2004; 2011-2013; 2016"".
2. This means he had three separate periods of activity: 
   - The first period was from 1996 to 2004, which is 8 years.
   - The second period was from 2011 to 2013, which is 2 years.
   - The third period was in 2016, which is 1 year.
3. To find the total number of years he was active in wrestling, we add these periods together: 8 years + 2 years + 1 year = 11 years.

","To find the difference in years between the planned and elapsed time of the Orbiter Mission duration, we first need to identify these durations from the given information.

1. **Planned Mission Duration for the Orbiter**: The planned mission duration for the orbiter is given as ""~ 7.5 years"".

2. **Elapsed Mission Duration for the Orbiter**: The elapsed time for the orbiter is given as ""2 years, 10 months"".

Since we are asked to round up and find the difference in years, we first convert the elapsed time into just years. The elapsed time of ""2 years, 10 months"" can be approximated to 3 years when rounding up the months to the nearest year, because 10 months is more than half of a year.

3. **Calculating the Difference**: 
   - Planned duration: 7.5 years
   - Elapsed duration (rounded up): 3 years
   - Difference: 7.5 years - 3 years = 4.5 years

Rounding up the difference to the nearest whole year as the question implies we should round up, the difference becomes 5 years.

","To find out how many years after its first flight the Space Shuttle's first crewed flight occurred, we need to determine the years of both the first flight and the first crewed flight, and then calculate the difference between them.

1. The first flight of the Space Shuttle program, as indicated in the table under ""Program history,"" was on August 12, 1977.
2. The first crewed flight of the Space Shuttle program was on April 12, 1981.
3. To find the difference in years, we subtract the year of the first flight from the year of the first crewed flight: 1981 - 1977 = 4.

Therefore, the Space Shuttle's first crewed flight occurred 4 years after its first flight.

","To find the age at which Paul Gauguin died, we need to look at the information provided in the table about his birth and death dates.

1. **Identify Birth Date**: Paul Gauguin was born on 7 June 1848.
2. **Identify Death Date**: He died on 8 May 1903.
3. **Calculate Age at Death**: To find the age at death, we subtract the birth year from the death year and then consider the months and days to ensure accuracy.

Given that his birth month and day are June 7, and his death month and day are May 8, we can see that he had not yet had his birthday in the year he died. 

So, calculating the age:
- Death year: 1903
- Birth year: 1848
- Age at death = 1903 - 1848 = 55 years old, but since his birthday (June 7) had not occurred yet when he died (May 8), we need to subtract one year from this calculation.

Therefore, Paul Gauguin was 54 years old when he died.

","To find the age of Melissa Coates when she debuted at the IFBB Jan Tana Classic, we need to follow these steps:

1. Identify the year Melissa Coates debuted at the IFBB Jan Tana Classic. According to the table, her pro-debut was in 1996 at the IFBB Jan Tana Classic.

2. Identify Melissa Coates' birth year. The table states she was born on June 18, 1971.

3. Calculate the age of Melissa Coates at the time of her debut. Since she was born in 1971 and debuted in 1996, we subtract her birth year from the debut year to find the difference in years.

1996 (debut year) - 1971 (birth year) = 25 years

Therefore, when Melissa Coates debuted at the IFBB Jan Tana Classic in 1996, she was 25 years old, considering her birthday (June 18) would have already passed in 1996, as the event took place after her birthday that year.

Backwoods Barbie Tour | (2008) | Better Day World Tour | (2011) | Blue Smoke World Tour | (2014)

","To find the average length of time between Dolly Parton's tours in years, we first need to determine the time intervals between each tour.

1. The first tour mentioned is the Backwoods Barbie Tour, which took place in 2008.
2. The next tour is the Better Day World Tour, which occurred in 2011.
3. The last tour mentioned is the Blue Smoke World Tour, which happened in 2014.

Now, let's calculate the intervals between these tours:

- Interval between Backwoods Barbie Tour (2008) and Better Day World Tour (2011): 2011 - 2008 = 3 years.
- Interval between Better Day World Tour (2011) and Blue Smoke World Tour (2014): 2014 - 2011 = 3 years.

Since we have two intervals, to find the average length of time between Dolly Parton's tours, we add these intervals together and divide by the number of intervals:

Average = (3 years + 3 years) / 2 = 6 years / 2 = 3 years.

","To find the time difference in years between the first and last launch at site 200/39, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Identify the dates of the first and last launches** at site 200/39. 
   - The first launch was on 20 February 1980.
   - The last launch was on 13 December 2021.

2. **Calculate the time difference** between these two dates.
   - The difference can be calculated by subtracting the year of the first launch from the year of the last launch and then considering the months and days for a more precise calculation.

3. **Perform the calculation**:
   - Year difference: 2021 - 1980 = 41 years.
   - Since the first launch was in February and the last launch was in December, the actual time difference is slightly less than 42 years but more than 41 years because December comes after February.

4. **Round the result to the nearest year** if necessary. Given the first launch was early in the year and the last launch was late in the year, the difference is closer to 42 years than to 41 years when considering the full duration.

5. **Conclusion**: The time difference between the first and last"

","To find the time difference in years between the first and last launch at site 200/40, we need to follow these steps:

1. Identify the dates of the first and last launches at site 200/40.
2. Calculate the difference between these two dates in years.
3. Round this difference to the nearest year.

Step 1: The first launch at site 200/40 occurred on 23 July 1977, and the last launch occurred on 31 March 1991.

Step 2: To calculate the difference, we subtract the year of the first launch from the year of the last launch: 1991 - 1977 = 14 years.

However, since the first launch was in July and the last launch was in March, we need to consider if this affects the calculation significantly. Given that the last launch happened early in the year (March) and the first launch late in the year (July), the actual difference is slightly less than 14 full years because the last launch occurred before the anniversary of the first launch in the same year. 

But for simplicity and because the question asks for the answer rounded to the nearest year, we consider the full years passed.

","To find the time span of Sri Lanka's World Test Championship appearances in years, we need to identify the start and end years of their participation.

1. **Identify the start year of Sri Lanka's World Test Championship appearances**: According to the table, Sri Lanka's first World Test Championship appearance was in the 2019-2021 cycle. Therefore, the start year is 2019.

2. **Identify the end year of the mentioned World Test Championship appearances**: Since the table mentions the first appearance as being in the 2019-2021 cycle and does not specify any appearances beyond this cycle up to the given date (July 2022), we consider the end year of this cycle for calculation purposes, which is 2021.

3. **Calculate the time span**: The time span is calculated by subtracting the start year from the end year. However, since we're looking at a period that includes both the start and end years, we add 1 to the result to include both years in the count.

Time span = End year - Start year + 1 = 2021 - 2019 + 1 = 3 years.

","To find the total number of years that the Space Shuttle program lasted, we need to look at the start and end years of the program.

1. **Identify the start year**: According to the table, under ""Program history,"" the ""Duration"" of the Space Shuttle program is listed as ""1972-2011."" Therefore, the start year is 1972.

2. **Identify the end year**: From the same ""Duration"" listing, the end year of the program is 2011.

3. **Calculate the duration**: To find the total number of years the program lasted, subtract the start year from the end year and then add 1 (since both the start and end years are inclusive).
   
   Duration = End year - Start year + 1
   Duration = 2011 - 1972 + 1

","To find Murilo Bustamante's age when he attended the Brazilian National Championship for the first time, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Identify the year of the first attendance**: The table does not directly state the year Murilo Bustamante first attended the Brazilian National Championship. However, it lists his achievements in the championship, with the earliest year mentioned being 1996.

2. **Calculate the age**: Given that the earliest year mentioned for his participation in the Brazilian National Championship is 1996, and knowing his birthdate is July 30, 1966, we can calculate his age for that year.

3. **Perform the calculation**: 
    - Birth year: 1966
    - Year of the event: 1996
    - Age = Year of the event - Birth year
    - Age = 1996 - 1966 = 30

Since his birthday is on July 30, and assuming the Brazilian National Championship takes place before his birthday in 1996, he would have been 29 years old when he first attended. If the championship took place after his birthday, he would have been 30. However, without the exact date of the championship, we can't determine this precisely. Given"

1. **Identify the year Shabalin won his Olympic medal**: According to the table, Shabalin won a bronze medal at the 2010 Winter Olympics in Vancouver.

2. **Determine Shabalin's birth year**: The table states that Shabalin was born on January 25, 1982.

3. **Calculate Shabalin's age at the time of the 2010 Winter Olympics**: Since the 2010 Winter Olympics took place in the year 2010 and Shabalin was born in 1982, we subtract his birth year from the year of the Olympics to find his age. However, because his birthday is in January and the Olympics took place in February (the exact dates of the 2010 Winter Olympics were February 12–28, 2010), he would have already had his birthday that year.

So, the calculation is: 2010 - 1982 = 28 years old.

","To find the first year that someone could enter the Birmingham-Jefferson Convention Complex, we need to look at the information provided about its opening.

1. The table mentions that the complex was ""Opened"" in ""January 1972."" This indicates the month and year when the complex became accessible to the public for the first time.

2. Although the complex was ""Inaugurated"" in 1976, inauguration refers to the formal opening or introduction of something, which might not necessarily be the same as when it first became available for public use. Given that it opened in 1972, this suggests that people could enter and use the facilities before the formal inauguration in 1976.

3. There is no mention of any periods between 1972 and 1976 when the complex was closed to the public, which further supports the conclusion that 1972 was the first year someone could enter the complex.

Therefore, based on the information provided, the first year that someone could enter the Birmingham-Jefferson Convention Complex was 1972.

","To determine the year the Palace of Westminster was built, we need to look at the information provided in the table under the ""Built"" category.

1. The table mentions that the Palace of Westminster was built in 1016. 
2. It also provides additional information that it has been 1006 years since it was built, which aligns with the current year being 2022 (1016 + 1006 = 2022).
3. There's a mention of a fire in 1834 that led to its demolition, followed by a rebuild from 1840-1876, but this does not change the original construction year.

Therefore, based on the information given, the original construction of the Palace of Westminster began in 1016.

","To find the year the University of Cambridge was established, we need to look at the ""Established"" row in the table.

The ""Established"" row states ""circa |  1209 | ; 813 years ago |  ( | 1209 | )"". This means the university was established around the year 1209.

Since the current year is 2022 and it has been 813 years since the establishment, we can verify if the year 1209 is correct by subtracting 813 from 2022. 

2022 - 813 = 1209

This calculation confirms that the year of establishment is indeed 1209.

","To determine the year the University of Cambridge was founded, let's examine the information provided in the table.

1. **Look for the ""Established"" Section**: The table has a section titled ""Established"" which directly pertains to the founding year of the university.

2. **Identify the Year**: Within the ""Established"" section, it mentions ""circa |  1209 | ; 813 years ago |  ( | 1209 | )"". The term ""circa"" means approximately, but the specific year given is 1209.

3. **Consider the Current Year**: Since the question asks for the founding year and we know the information is current up to December 2022, we don't need to calculate anything based on the current year. The founding year is given directly.

4. **Conclusion**: Based on the information provided, the University of Cambridge was founded approximately in the year 1209.

Background information
Born	April 7, 1908 | Toronto, Ontario, Canada
Died	February 9, 1976 | (1976-02-09) |  (aged 67) | Encino, California, U.S.
Occupation(s)	Bandleader, orchestrator, composer

","To find out how old Percy Faith was while at work in 1949, we need to follow these steps:

1. Identify the birth year of Percy Faith: According to the table, Percy Faith was born on April 7, 1908.
2. Identify the year in question: The year we are interested in is 1949, when the photos of Faith at work were taken.
3. Calculate the age: To find out how old Percy Faith was in 1949, we subtract his birth year from the year in question. So, 1949 - 1908 = 41.

Since the photos were taken in 1949 and we don't have the exact date, we consider his age throughout that year. Given that his birthday is on April 7, if the photos were taken before April 7, 1949, he would have been 40 years old, and if taken on or after April 7, 1949, he would have been 41 years old.

However, without the exact date of the photos, the most accurate answer based on the information provided and assuming the question implies any time during 1949 would be that he was either 40 or 41, depending on when in 1949 the photos"
