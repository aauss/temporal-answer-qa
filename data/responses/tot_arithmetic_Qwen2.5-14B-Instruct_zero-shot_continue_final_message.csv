Adding 1209 days directly without considering leap years or month lengths would be complex, so let's break it down into years and remaining days. 1209 days is equivalent to 3 years and 84 days (since 1209 = 3 * 365 + 84).

To simplify, let's break down the calculation:\n\nFirst, find the number of full years covered by 1148 days. There are 365 days in a common year and 366 in a leap year.\n\n1148 days / 365 days/year ≈ 3.145 years, which indicates that it covers 3 full years plus some extra days.\n\n2016 is a leap year, so it has 366 days.

Next, we need to find out what the date will be 1971 days from December 30, 2016. To do this, we divide 1971 by 365 (the number of days in a year) to find out how many years and extra days that span covers: 1971 / 365 ≈ 5.4 years, meaning it spans about 5 years and an additional 286 days (since 1971 - (5 * 365) = 286). Adding 5 full years to December 30, 2016, brings us to December 30, 2021. From there, we add the remaining 286 days. We can break down these days into months, starting from December 30, 2021.

Therefore, for 1 cake, we divide each component by 2. Hours: 3/2 = 1.5 hours; Minutes: 49/2 = 24.5 minutes; Seconds: 52/2 = 26 seconds. To convert the fractional hours into minutes, we take 0.5 hours * 60 = 30 minutes. Adding this to 24.5 minutes gives us 54.5 minutes. We further convert the 0.5 minutes into seconds which is 0.5 * 60 = 30 seconds. So, the time to bake 1 cake is 1 hour, 54 minutes, and 30 seconds. For 7 cakes, multiply each component by 7. Hours: 1*7 = 7 hours; Minutes: 54*7 = 378 minutes; Seconds: 30*7 = 210 seconds. Convert excess minutes to hours: 378 minutes / 60 = 6.3 hours. Thus, we have 6 full hours and 0.3 hours left in minutes (0.3 * 60 = 18 minutes). Similarly, convert excess seconds to minutes: 210 seconds / 60 = 3.5 minutes. This adds up to 18 + 3.5 = 21.5 minutes, which we can convert to 21 minutes and 30 seconds. Finally, add these to the total time: 7 hours + 6 hours = 13 hours, 21 minutes, and 30 seconds."", ""H"": 13, ""M"": 21, ""S"": 30}"

2. Divide this by 2 to get the time per page: \(15884 / 2 = 7942\) seconds per page.
3. Multiply by 23 to get the time for 23 pages: \(7942 \times 23 = 182666\) seconds.

Since translating 10 pages is five times more work than translating 2 pages, we multiply the given time by 5. First, convert everything into seconds for easier calculation: 3 hours * 3600 seconds/hour + 45 minutes * 60 seconds/minute + 54 seconds = 10800 + 2700 + 54 = 13554 seconds. Multiplying this total by 5 gives 13554 * 5 = 67770 seconds. Now convert back to hours, minutes, and seconds: 67770 seconds / 3600 seconds/hour = 18 hours with a remainder of 2770 seconds. 2770 seconds / 60 seconds/minute = 46 minutes with a remainder of 10 seconds.

The remainder after taking out the hours is 8082 - (2 * 3600) = 882 seconds. Since there are 60 seconds in a minute, 882 / 60 = 14.7, meaning there are 14 full minutes.
