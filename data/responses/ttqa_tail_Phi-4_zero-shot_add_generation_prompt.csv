","To determine the age at which Dhanraj Pillay competed in his first Asian Games, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Identify the Year of the First Asian Games Participation:**
   - From the table, we see that Dhanraj Pillay's first Asian Games participation was in 1990 in Beijing.

2. **Determine Dhanraj Pillay's Birth Year:**
   - According to the table, Dhanraj Pillay was born on 16 July 1968.

3. **Calculate His Age in 1990:**
   - To find out how old he was in 1990, subtract his birth year from the year of the event:  
     \(1990 - 1968 = 22\).

4. **Check if He Had Already Had His Birthday in 1990:**
   - Since the Asian Games in 1990 took place before 16 July, and he was born on 16 July, he would not have turned 22 yet in 1990. Therefore, he was still 21 at the time of the event.

Thus, Dhanraj Pillay was 21 years old when he competed in his first Asian Games.

Final Answer: 21 years old."

","To determine the age at which Kimi Räikkönen won his first Formula One World Championship, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Identify the Year of the First Championship Win:**
   - According to the table, Kimi Räikkönen won his first Formula One World Championship in 2007.

2. **Determine Kimi Räikkönen's Birth Year:**
   - The table states that Kimi Räikkönen was born on 17 October 1979.

3. **Calculate His Age in 2007:**
   - To find out how old he was in 2007, subtract his birth year from the year he won the championship:  
     \( 2007 - 1979 = 28 \).

4. **Check if He Had Already Had His Birthday in 2007:**
   - Since his birthday is on 17 October and the Formula One season typically concludes in November or December, he would have already turned 28 by the time he won the championship in 2007.

Therefore, Kimi Räikkönen was 28 years old when he won his first Formula One World Championship.

Final Answer: 28 years old."

3. **Find the Sinking Date of I-176:**
   - Historical records indicate that the sister ship I-176 was sunk on 19 February 1942.

4. **Calculate the Days Between Launch and Sinking for I-176:**

","To determine how many days apart the Armenian Patriarchate of Jerusalem and the Armenian Apostolic Church celebrate Christmas, we need to analyze the dates provided in the table:

1. **Armenian Apostolic Church**: Celebrates Christmas on January 6 (non-O.S.).
2. **Armenian Patriarchate of Jerusalem**: Celebrates Christmas on January 19 (O.S. Jan. 6).

First, we need to convert the Old Style (O.S.) date for the Armenian Patriarchate of Jerusalem to the New Style (non-O.S.) date. The Old Style Julian calendar is 13 days behind the New Style Gregorian calendar as of the 20th and 21st centuries.

- **January 6 (O.S.)** is equivalent to **January 19 (non-O.S.)**.

Now, both celebrations are on January 19 (non-O.S.):

- **Armenian Apostolic Church**: January 6 (non-O.S.)
- **Armenian Patriarchate of Jerusalem**: January 19 (non-O.S.)

Finally, calculate the difference in days between January 6 and January 19:

","To determine how many months passed between HMS Montrose being laid down and launched, we need to look at the specific dates provided in the table:

1. **Laid Down Date:** 1 November 1989
2. **Launched Date:** 31 July 1992

Now, let's calculate the time between these two dates:

- **From 1 November 1989 to 1 November 1990:** 12 months
- **From 1 November 1990 to 1 November 1991:** 12 months
- **From 1 November 1991 to 1 November 1992:** 12 months

However, since the launch date is 31 July 1992, we need to subtract the months from November 1992 back to July 1992:

- **From 1 November 1992 to 31 July 1992:** 3 months (August, September, October)

So, the total number of months from 1 November 1989 to 31 July 1992 is:

","To determine how many more months the ExoMars mission is planned to last, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Identify the Planned Mission Duration:**
   - The table states that the mission duration is ""Planned: 7 years.""

2. **Identify the Elapsed Mission Duration:**
   - The elapsed mission duration is given as ""6 years, 3 months, 18 days.""

3. **Calculate the Remaining Duration:**
   - First, convert the planned duration into months: 
     - 7 years = 7 × 12 months = 84 months.
   - Next, convert the elapsed duration into months:
     - 6 years = 6 × 12 months = 72 months.
     - Add the additional 3 months: 72 months + 3 months = 75 months.
   - The elapsed duration in months is 75 months.

4. **Subtract the Elapsed Duration from the Planned Duration:**
   - Remaining duration = Planned duration - Elapsed duration
   - Remaining duration = 84 months - 75 months = 9 months.

Therefore, the ExoMars mission is planned to last 9 more months.

Final Answer: 9 months."

","To determine the total number of years Michael Schumacher was active in his career, we need to consider both his Formula One World Championship career and his participation in the 24 Hours of Le Mans.

1. **Formula One World Championship Career:**
   - Schumacher's active years in Formula One were from 1991 to 2006, and then again from 2010 to 2012.
   - From 1991 to 2006 is a span of 16 years (including both 1991 and 2006).
   - From 2010 to 2012 is a span of 3 years (including both 2010 and 2012).
   - Total years in Formula One = 16 + 3 = 19 years.

2. **24 Hours of Le Mans Career:**
   - Schumacher participated in the 24 Hours of Le Mans in 1991.
   - This adds 1 year to his active career.

3. **Total Active Years:**
   - Since the year 1991 is counted in both his Formula One and Le Mans careers, we do not double-count it.
   - Total active years = 19 (Formula One) + 1 (Le Mans, not double-count"

","To determine how many years after HMS Argyll was ordered it was launched, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Identify the Order Date:**
   - HMS Argyll was ordered in September 1986.

2. **Identify the Launch Date:**
   - HMS Argyll was launched on 8 April 1989.

3. **Calculate the Time Between the Two Dates:**
   - From September 1986 to September 1987 is 1 year.
   - From September 1987 to September 1988 is another year, making it 2 years.
   - From September 1988 to April 1989 is an additional 7 months.

4. **Convert the Time to Years:**
   - 7 months is approximately 0.58 years (since 7/12 ≈ 0.58).

5. **Add the Years and Months:**
   - Total time from order to launch = 2 years + 0.58 years = 2.58 years.

Since we are asked for the number of years, we can round 2.58 years to the nearest whole number, which is 3 years.

**Final Answer:** HMS Argyll was launched approximately 3"

","To determine how many years after HMS Montrose was ordered in 2005 it was launched, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Identify the Year HMS Montrose was Ordered:**
   - According to the table, HMS Montrose was ordered in July 1988, not 2005. However, the question asks about the year 2005, so we will use 2005 as the starting point for our calculation.

2. **Identify the Year HMS Montrose was Launched:**
   - The table states that HMS Montrose was launched on 31 July 1992.

3. **Calculate the Number of Years Between 2005 and 1992:**
   - Since the launch year (1992) is before the year 2005, we need to calculate the difference in years from 2005 to 1992.
   - 2005 - 1992 = 13 years

4. **Determine the Direction of the Calculation:**
   - Since the launch occurred before 2005, we are actually looking at how many years before 2005 the launch occurred.

Final Answer: HMS Montrose was launched 13 years before 2005."

","To determine how many years after being ordered HMS Victory was launched, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Identify the Order Date:**
   - HMS Victory was ordered on 14 July 1758.

2. **Identify the Launch Date:**
   - HMS Victory was launched on 7 May 1765.

3. **Calculate the Time Difference:**
   - From 14 July 1758 to 14 July 1765 is exactly 7 years.
   - Since the launch date, 7 May 1765, is before 14 July 1765, we need to subtract the time from 7 May to 14 July.

4. **Calculate the Months and Days Difference:**
   - From 7 May to 7 July is 2 months.
   - From 7 July to 14 July is 7 days.

5. **Adjust the Year Calculation:**
   - Since the launch date is 2 months and 7 days before 14 July 1765, we subtract this period from the 7 years calculated.

6. **Final Calculation:**
   - 7 years minus 2 months and 7 days is 6 years, 10 months, and 23 days.

","To determine how many years after the HMS Astute was ordered the picture was taken, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Identify the Order Date**: The HMS Astute was ordered in March 1997.

2. **Identify the Picture Date**: The picture is identified as ""Astute Crest.jpg,"" but the table does not provide a specific date for when this picture was taken. Therefore, we need to make an assumption based on the information available.

3. **Assume the Picture Date**: Since the table does not specify when the picture was taken, we can assume it was taken at a significant point in the submarine's history. A reasonable assumption is that the picture was taken around the time the submarine was commissioned or entered service, as these are notable events.

4. **Identify the Commissioning Date**: The HMS Astute was commissioned on 27 August 2010.

5. **Calculate the Time Difference**: Calculate the number of years between the order date (March 1997) and the commissioning date (August 2010).

   - From March 1997 to March 2010 is 13 years.
   - From March 2010 to August 2010 is an additional 5 months.

","To determine how many years after the Years of Lead began did the Bologna massacre occur, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Identify the Start of the Years of Lead:**
   - According to the table, the Years of Lead in Italy began in ""Late 1968.""

2. **Identify the Year of the Bologna Massacre:**
   - The table states that the Bologna massacre occurred in ""August 1980.""

3. **Calculate the Number of Years Between the Start and the Massacre:**
   - The Years of Lead started in late 1968. For calculation purposes, we can consider it as 1968.
   - The Bologna massacre occurred in 1980.

4. **Subtract the Start Year from the Massacre Year:**
   - 1980 (year of the Bologna massacre) - 1968 (start of the Years of Lead) = 12 years.

Therefore, the Bologna massacre occurred 12 years after the Years of Lead began.

1. **Identify the Year of the Last Championships:**
   - The table mentions ""← 2016 | 2019 →"" under the ""Medalists"" section. This indicates that the 2016 championships were before the 2017 championships, and the 2019 championships were after the 2017 championships.

","To determine the number of years between Madan Lal's last Test match and his ODI debut, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Identify the Date of ODI Debut:**
   - According to the table, Madan Lal's ODI debut was on 13 July 1974.

2. **Identify the Date of Last Test Match:**
   - The table states that Madan Lal's last Test match was on 19 June 1986.

3. **Calculate the Time Difference:**
   - First, calculate the difference in years between 1986 and 1974:
     \[
     1986 - 1974 = 12 \text{ years}
     \]
   - Next, consider the months and days to adjust the year difference:
     - Madan Lal's ODI debut was in July 1974, and his last Test was in June 1986.
     - Since June 1986 is before July 1986, we do not complete the full 12th year.

4. **Final Calculation:**
   - Therefore, the time between his ODI debut and his last Test is 11 years and 11 months.

","To determine how many years the New Order had been fighting when the National Vanguard joined, we need to identify the start and join years for both groups.

1. **Identify the start year of the New Order:**
   - According to the table, the New Order was active from 1957 to 1973.

2. **Identify the start year of the National Vanguard:**
   - The National Vanguard was active from 1960 to 1976.

3. **Calculate the number of years the New Order had been active by the time the National Vanguard started:**
   - The New Order started in 1957.
   - The National Vanguard started in 1960.
   - Calculate the difference: 1960 - 1957 = 3 years.

Therefore, the New Order had been fighting for 3 years when the National Vanguard joined.

","To determine how many years Tochiazuma Daisuke was a sumo wrestler, we need to consider the following information from the table:

1. **Debut Date**: November, 1994
2. **Retirement Date**: May, 2007

Now, let's calculate the duration of his career:

- **End Year**: 2007

To find the number of years between 1994 and 2007, we subtract the start year from the end year:

\[ 2007 - 1994 = 13 \]

However, since he debuted in November 1994 and retired in May 2007, he did not complete the full year of 2007. Therefore, we need to adjust our calculation:

- From November 1994 to November 2006 is 12 full years.
- From November 2006 to May 2007 is an additional 6 months.

Thus, Tochiazuma Daisuke was a sumo wrestler for 12 years and 6 months.

   - According to the table, Räikkönen's first Formula One win was at the 2003 Malaysian Grand Prix.
   - Therefore, the year of his first Formula One win is 2003.

2. **Identify the year of Räikkönen's first World Rally Championship rally:**
   - The table states that Räikkönen's first World Rally Championship rally was the 2009 Rally Finland.
   - Therefore, the year of his first World Rally Championship rally is 2009.

3. **Calculate the number of years between these two events:**
   - Subtract the year of the first Formula One win from the year of the first World Rally Championship rally:  
     \( 2009 - 2003 = 6 \)

Thus, there were 6 years between Räikkönen's first Formula One win and his first World Rally Championship rally.

","To determine the number of years between when HMS Argyll was ordered and when it was commissioned, we need to identify the relevant dates from the table and calculate the difference between them.

1. **Identify the date when HMS Argyll was ordered:**
   - Ordered: September 1986

2. **Identify the date when HMS Argyll was commissioned:**
   - Commissioned: 31 May 1991

3. **Calculate the difference in years between the two dates:**
   - From September 1986 to September 1990 is 4 years.
   - From September 1990 to May 1991 is an additional 8 months.

Since we are calculating the difference in years, we consider the full years first and then account for the additional months.

- The full years between September 1986 and September 1990 is 4 years.
- The additional months from September 1990 to May 1991 do not complete another full year.

Therefore, the total time from when HMS Argyll was ordered to when it was commissioned is 4 years and 8 months.

**Final Answer:** 4 years and 8 months."

","To determine how old Gino Bartali was when he joined his first professional team, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Identify the Year He Joined His First Professional Team:**
   - According to the table, Gino Bartali joined his first professional team, Fréjus, in 1935.

2. **Determine His Birth Year:**
   - The table states that Gino Bartali was born on 18 July 1914.

3. **Calculate His Age in 1935:**
   - Subtract the birth year from the year he joined his first professional team:  
     \( 1935 - 1914 = 21 \).

4. **Check if He Had Already Had His Birthday in 1935:**
   - Since he was born on 18 July and joined the team in 1935, we need to determine if he had already turned 21 by the time he joined.
   - If he joined before 18 July 1935, he would still be 20. If he joined on or after 18 July 1935, he would be 21.

5. **Conclusion:**
   - The table does not specify the exact date he joined Fréjus in 193"

   - According to the table, Jayasuriya played for Bloomfield from 1994 to 2011. Therefore, he started playing for Bloomfield in 1994.

2. **Determine Jayasuriya's Birth Year:**
   - The table states that Jayasuriya was born on 30 June 1969.

3. **Calculate Jayasuriya's Age in 1994:**

     \[
     1994 - 1969 = 25
     \]
   - Since his birthday is on 30 June, and he started playing for Bloomfield in 1994, we need to check if he had already turned 25 by the time he started playing that year. If he started playing before 30 June 1994, he would still be 24. If he started after 30 June 1994, he would be 25.

","To answer the question, we need to determine the year when the Australian Defence Force's annual exports were around $2 billion and the active personnel count was 59,095.

1. **Identify the Year of Active Personnel Count:**
   - The table provides the active personnel count as 59,095 for the date 30 June 2020.

2. **Identify the Year of Annual Exports:**
   - The table states that the annual exports were around $2 billion in 2018.

3. **Determine if Both Conditions Occurred in the Same Year:**
   - The active personnel count of 59,095 is specified for 30 June 2020.
   - The annual exports of around $2 billion are specified for 2018.

Since the active personnel count and the annual exports are from different years (2020 and 2018, respectively), there is no single year in which both conditions are met simultaneously.

**Final Answer:** There is no year in which the Australian Defence Force's annual exports totaled around $2 billion while the active personnel count was 59,095."

","To determine the year in which Alejandro Valverde achieved his first Tour de France victory, we need to analyze the information provided in the table regarding his major wins, specifically focusing on the Tour de France.

1. **Identify Tour de France Wins**: The table lists Valverde's major wins, including his achievements in the Tour de France. It states that he won 4 individual stages in the years 2005, 2008, and 2012.

2. **Check for General Classification Wins**: The table does not mention Valverde winning the overall general classification (GC) of the Tour de France. The GC win is typically considered a victory in the context of the Tour de France.

3. **Conclusion**: Since the table only lists stage wins and not a general classification win, Alejandro Valverde did not achieve a Tour de France victory in terms of winning the overall race.

Final Answer: Alejandro Valverde did not achieve a Tour de France victory in terms of winning the overall general classification."

","To determine over how many months Hurricane Gaston existed, we need to consider the dates it formed and dissipated.

1. **Formation Date**: August 27, 2004
2. **Dissipation Date**: September 3, 2004

Now, let's calculate the duration:

- **Start Date**: August 27, 2004
- **End Date**: September 3, 2004

To find the number of days between these two dates:

- From August 27 to August 31 is 5 days (including August 27).
- From September 1 to September 3 is 3 days.

Adding these together gives us a total of 8 days.

Since the duration is 8 days, it spans parts of two months: August and September. However, since it does not cover a full month in either, it does not span over any full months.

**Final Answer:** Hurricane Gaston existed over parts of two months, but not over any full months."

","To find the difference in the synodic period between Mars and Earth, we need to understand what a synodic period is. The synodic period is the time it takes for a planet to return to the same position relative to the Earth and the Sun. For Earth, the synodic period is essentially one year (365.25 days) because it is the time it takes for Earth to complete one orbit around the Sun relative to the Sun.

Given:
- The synodic period of Mars is 779.96 days.

Steps to find the difference:

1. **Convert the synodic period of Mars from days to years:**

   \[
   \text{Synodic period of Mars in years} = \frac{779.96 \text{ days}}{365.25 \text{ days/year}} \approx 2.1354 \text{ years}
   \]

2. **Calculate the difference between the synodic period of Mars and Earth:**

   \[
   \text{Difference} = 2.1354 \text{ years (Mars)} - 1 \text{ year (Earth)} = 1.1354 \text{ years}
   \]

Final Answer: The difference in the synodic period between Mars and"

","To determine Jenson Button's age when he won the Super GT GT500 Championship, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Identify the Year of the Championship Win:**
   - According to the table, Jenson Button won the Super GT GT500 Championship in 2018.

2. **Determine Jenson Button's Birth Year:**
   - The table states that Jenson Button was born on January 19, 1980.

3. **Calculate His Age in 2018:**
   - To find his age in 2018, subtract his birth year from the year he won the championship:  
     \( 2018 - 1980 = 38 \).

4. **Check if He Had Already Celebrated His Birthday in 2018:**
   - Since the championship win occurred in 2018 and his birthday is on January 19, he would have already turned 38 by the time he won the championship.

Therefore, Jenson Button was 38 years old when he won the Super GT GT500 Championship.

Final Answer: 38 years old."
