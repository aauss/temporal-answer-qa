","Jeffrey Epstein was apprehended on July 6, 2019, and he died by suicide on August 10, 2019. To find the number of months between these two dates, we calculate the time from July 6 to August 10.

- From July 6 to July 31 is 25 days.
- From August 1 to August 10 is 10 days.

Adding these gives a total of 35 days. Since a month is approximately 30 days, 35 days is just over one month.

Final Answer: Approximately 1 month."

Since the exact start date of his sentence is not provided, we can assume it was around the time of his conviction in 2008.

Epstein was born on January 20, 1953. If he started his sentence in 2008, he would have been 55 years old at the beginning of that year. Assuming he began his sentence shortly after his conviction in 2008, he would have been 55 years old when he received work release.

Since ""The Storm"" was completed in 1880 and his birthday is on February 17, we need to check if he had already turned 43 by the time the painting was completed. If ""The Storm"" was completed after February 17, 1880, he would have been 43. If it was completed before February 17, he would still have been 42.

Lead position ends	16 October 2023
Jurist term ends	6 October 2024

","To determine how many more years Esther Hayut has been with the Supreme Court of Israel compared to Uzi Vogelman, we need to calculate the duration each has served as of the current date, December 2022.

1. **Esther Hayut:**
   - Started as President on 26 October 2017.
   - As of December 2022, the time from October 2017 to December 2022 is approximately 5 years and 2 months.

2. **Uzi Vogelman:**
   - Started as Deputy President on 9 May 2022.
   - As of December 2022, the time from May 2022 to December 2022 is approximately 7 months.

Now, calculate the difference in their service durations:
- Convert Esther Hayut's service duration to months: 5 years and 2 months = 62 months.
- Convert Uzi Vogelman's service duration to months: 7 months.

Subtract Vogelman's duration from Hayut's duration:
- 62 months (Hayut) - 7 months (Vogelman) = 55 months.

Convert the difference back to years:
- 55 months is approximately 4 years and 7 months.

","Alphonse Gallegos was appointed as Auxiliary Bishop of Sacramento on 24 August 1981 and served as Titular Bishop of Sasabe from 1981 to 1991. His term as Auxiliary Bishop ended on 6 October 1991. Therefore, he held both positions from 24 August 1981 until 6 October 1991.

To calculate the number of years he held both positions, we consider the period from 24 August 1981 to 6 October 1991:

- From 24 August 1981 to 24 August 1991 is exactly 10 years.
- From 24 August 1991 to 6 October 1991 is an additional 1 month and 12 days.

Thus, he held both positions for 10 years and a little over 1 month.

","To determine how long Argentina's Men's football team was ranked number one for the longest time, we need to look at the periods when they held the top FIFA ranking:

1. March 2007
2. October 2007 - June 2008
3. July-October 2015
4. April 2016 - April 2017

Let's calculate the duration for each period:

1. **March 2007**: This is a single month, so it lasted 1 month.

2. **October 2007 - June 2008**:
   - Start: October 2007
   - End: June 2008
   - Duration: October, November, December, January, February, March, April, May, June = 9 months

3. **July-October 2015**:
   - Start: July 2015
   - End: October 2015
   - Duration: July, August, September, October = 4 months

4. **April 2016 - April 2017**:
   - Start: April 2016
   - End: April 2017
   - Duration: April 2016 to April 2017 = 12 months"

Miloš Obrenović I | Милош Обреновић I
['MilosObrenovic 1848.jpg']

Prince of Serbia
Reign	6 November 1817 - 25 June 1839
Predecessor	Himself (As Grand Vožd of Serbia)
Successor	Milan II

Grand Vožd of Serbia
Reign	23 April 1815 - 6 November 1817
Predecessor	Karađorđe
Successor	Himself (as Prince of Serbia)
Died	26 September 1860 (aged 77 or 80) | Belgrade, Serbia, Ottoman Empire
Burial	St. Mark's Church, Belgrade, Serbia
Consort	Ljubica Vukomanović
Issue	Princess Petria | Princess Elisabeth | Prince Milan Obrenovic II | Prince Michael Obrenovic III | Princess Maria | Prince Todor | Prince Gabriel
House	Obrenović
Father	Teodor Mihailović
Mother	Višnja Urošević
Religion	Serbian Orthodox

","Miloš Obrenović I's reign as Grand Vožd of Serbia was from 23 April 1815 to 6 November 1817. During this period, Karađorđe was his predecessor, not his successor. Miloš Obrenović I became the Prince of Serbia after Karađorđe, so Karađorđe was not his successor in any of his reigns.

To find the duration of his reign as Grand Vožd of Serbia:
- Start date: 23 April 1815
- End date: 6 November 1817

Calculate the time between these dates:
- From 23 April 1815 to 23 April 1816 is 1 year.
- From 23 April 1816 to 23 April 1817 is another year, totaling 2 years.
- From 23 April 1817 to 6 November 1817 is 6 months and 13 days.

Therefore, Miloš Obrenović I's reign as Grand Vožd of Serbia lasted 2 years, 6 months, and 13 days.

Final Answer: Miloš Obrenović I's reign in which Karađorđe was his predecessor lasted 2 years"

","To determine how long the Valen Chapel has been open in total, we need to consider the periods it was active:

1. **First Period of Activity**: The church was originally completed in 1707 and closed in 1873. Therefore, it was open from 1707 to 1873.
   - Duration: 1873 - 1707 = 166 years

2. **Second Period of Activity**: The church was reconsecrated and reopened on 31 July 1949 and has been active since then. Assuming it is still open as of December 2022:
   - Duration: 2022 - 1949 = 73 years

Now, add the two periods of activity together:
- Total years open = 166 years + 73 years = 239 years

","Alojzije Mišić's term as bishop began on 29 April 1912 and ended on 26 March 1942. To calculate the length of his term in years, we consider the start and end dates:

- Start date: 29 April 1912
- End date: 26 March 1942

From 29 April 1912 to 29 April 1941 is 29 years. Since his term ended on 26 March 1942, which is just before his 30th anniversary as bishop, we do not count the full year of 1942.

","To find out how many days after being laid down INS Trishul was launched, we need to calculate the number of days between the two dates provided:

- Laid down: 24 September 1999
- Launched: 24 November 2000

First, calculate the number of days from 24 September 1999 to 24 September 2000:

- From 24 September 1999 to 24 September 2000 is exactly 1 year.
- Since 2000 is a leap year, this period includes 366 days.

Next, calculate the number of days from 24 September 2000 to 24 November 2000:

- From 24 September to 30 September is 6 days.
- October has 31 days.
- From 1 November to 24 November is 24 days.

Adding these together gives:

6 (September) + 31 (October) + 24 (November) = 61 days

Now, add the days from both periods:

366 days (from 24 September 1999 to 24 September 2000) + 61 days (from 24 September 2000 to 24 November 2000) = 427 days

","The groundbreaking for All Hallows Twickenham took place on 11 July 1939. The construction was completed and the church was consecrated on 9 November 1940. To find the number of days between these two dates, we need to calculate the days from 11 July 1939 to 9 November 1940.

1. **From 11 July 1939 to 11 July 1940** is exactly 1 year, which is 365 days (1939 is not a leap year).

2. **From 11 July 1940 to 9 November 1940**:

   - September: 30 days
   - October: 31 days
   - November 1 to November 9: 9 days

   - The main earthquake occurred on 29 February 1960.
   - The period between the main earthquake and the first aftershock is from 29 February to 22 March, which is 22 days.

Now, we compare the periods:

1. **From 27 April 1951 to 27 April 1952** is exactly 1 year, which is 365 days (1951 is not a leap year).

2. **From 27 April 1952 to 3 April 1952** is a backward calculation, so we need to subtract the days from 3 April to 27 April 1952.

   - April has 30 days, so from 3 April to 27 April is 24 days.

3. Subtract the 24 days from the 365 days:

   \[
   365 - 24 = 341 \text{ days}
   \]

","Ambrose Rayappan was ordained on 16 December 1923 and consecrated on 25 March 1953. To find the number of full years between these two dates, we calculate the difference between the years 1953 and 1923, which is 30 years. However, since his ordination was in December 1923 and his consecration was in March 1953, he did not complete the full year of 1953. Therefore, we subtract one year from the total.

1953 - 1923 = 30 years  
Since he was consecrated before completing the full year of 1953, we subtract 1 year.

30 - 1 = 29 full years

","To determine how many months after INS Trishul was ordered it was officially commissioned, we need to calculate the time between the order date and the commissioning date.

1. **Order Date:** 17 November 1997
2. **Commissioning Date:** 25 June 2003

Now, calculate the time between these two dates:

- From 17 November 1997 to 17 November 2002 is 5 years.
- From 17 November 2002 to 17 June 2003 is 7 months.
- From 17 June 2003 to 25 June 2003 is an additional 8 days.

Convert the total time into months:

- 5 years = 5 × 12 = 60 months
- Add the 7 months from November 2002 to June 2003.

","Bayinnaung began his reign as King of Burma on 30 April 1550. His coronation in Toungoo took place on 11 January 1551. To find out how many months passed between these two dates, we calculate the time from April 1550 to January 1551.

- From April 1550 to April 1551 is 12 months.
- Since the coronation was in January 1551, we count the months from April 1550 to January 1551: April, May, June, July, August, September, October, November, December, and January. This totals 9 months.

","The first crewed flight of the Space Shuttle program was STS-1 on April 12, 1981. The last flight was STS-135 on July 21, 2011.

To calculate the number of months between these two dates:

1. From April 12, 1981, to April 12, 2011, is exactly 30 years.
2. From April 12, 2011, to July 21, 2011, is 3 months and 9 days.

Since we are calculating the number of full months, we consider only the full months between the two dates.

Therefore, the total number of months is 30 years × 12 months/year + 3 months = 360 months + 3 months = 363 months.

","The X-15 had its first flight on 8 June 1959 and was introduced on 17 September 1959. To find the number of months between these two dates, we calculate the difference between June and September:

- From 8 June to 8 July is 1 month.
- From 8 July to 8 August is another month, making it 2 months.
- From 8 August to 8 September is another month, making it 3 months.

Since the introduction date is 17 September, which is after 8 September, we still count it as 3 full months.

- From 23 March to 17 April is less than a full month.

Therefore, the total time from the first foreshock to the last aftershock is 1 month and 24 days. In terms of months, this is approximately 1 month and a little over 3 weeks, but since we are asked for the number of months, we consider only the full months.

","The 2021 Myanmar protests began on 2 February 2021. The death toll reached 2,037 protesters as of 23 May 2021, according to the Assistance Association for Political Prisoners (AAPP). To find out when the death toll reached 2,091, we need to determine the additional deaths beyond 2,037 and calculate the time it took to reach 2,091.

1. Calculate the additional deaths needed to reach 2,091:
   \[
   2,091 - 2,037 = 54 \text{ additional deaths}
   \]

2. Since the death toll of 2,037 was reported on 23 May 2021, we need to determine when the additional 54 deaths occurred. However, the table does not provide a specific date for when the death toll reached 2,091. Without additional data, we cannot determine the exact date or month when the death toll reached 2,091.

Therefore, based on the information provided, we cannot calculate the number of months after the start of the protests when the death toll reached 2,091.

","The Mars Express mission duration is given as ""19 years and 1 month since launch"" and ""18 years, 6 months and 7 days at Mars."" The current date is December 2022. 

1. Calculate the total mission duration in months:
   - 19 years and 1 month = 19 * 12 + 1 = 229 months

2. Calculate the elapsed time from the launch date (June 2, 2003) to December 2022:
   - From June 2003 to June 2022 is 19 years = 19 * 12 = 228 months
   - From June 2022 to December 2022 is 6 months
   - Total elapsed time = 228 + 6 = 234 months

3. Calculate the remaining months:
   - Total mission duration = 229 months
   - Elapsed time = 234 months
   - Remaining months = 229 - 234 = -5 months

Since the elapsed time exceeds the mission duration, the mission has already surpassed its planned duration by 5 months.

","To determine how many months Theo Bot served as Ambassador to Austria, we need to calculate the duration between his start and end dates in that role.

- Start date: 17 January 1968
- End date: 1 July 1973

First, calculate the number of full years between 1968 and 1973:

- From 17 January 1968 to 17 January 1973 is 5 years.

Next, calculate the additional months from 17 January 1973 to 1 July 1973:

- From 17 January to 17 June is 5 months.
- From 17 June to 1 July is an additional 15 days, which is approximately half a month.

Adding these together:

- 5 years = 60 months
- 5 months + approximately 0.5 months = 5.5 months

Total duration: 60 months + 5.5 months = 65.5 months

Since we typically count full months, we can round down to 65 months.

","To determine how many more years Libya supported the EPRDF compared to the other side in the Ethiopian Civil War, we need to look at the periods of support for each side:

1. **Libya's support for the EPRDF:**
   - The EPRDF is not explicitly mentioned as being supported by Libya in the table. However, the EPLF and TPLF, which were part of the EPRDF coalition, were supported by Libya from 1977 to 1985. This is a period of 8 years.

2. **Libya's support for the Derg:**
   - Libya supported the Derg from 1985 to 1991. This is a period of 6 years.

Now, we calculate the difference in years of support:

- Libya supported the EPRDF (through EPLF/TPLF) for 8 years.
- Libya supported the Derg for 6 years.

The difference is 8 years - 6 years = 2 years.

","Roy Emerson began his amateur tennis career in 1953 and turned professional in 1968. He retired in 1983. To find the total number of years he played as both an amateur and a professional, we need to calculate the duration from the start of his amateur career to his retirement.

1. Calculate the years from the start of his amateur career to his retirement:
   - Start year: 1953
   - Retirement year: 1983
   - Total years: 1983 - 1953 = 30 years

Roy Emerson played for a total of 30 years as both an amateur and a professional.

","The JF-17 Thunder had its first flight on 25 August 2003 and was introduced on 12 March 2007. To find out how many years passed between these two dates, we calculate the difference between 2007 and 2003.

2007 - 2003 = 4 years

However, since the introduction date (12 March 2007) is before the first flight date (25 August 2003) within the year 2007, we need to account for the months and days to determine if a full year has passed. From 25 August 2003 to 25 August 2006 is exactly 3 years. From 25 August 2006 to 12 March 2007 is an additional 6 months and 18 days, which is less than a full year.

Therefore, the JF-17 Thunder was introduced 3 years and a few months after its first flight.

","To determine how many years after winning his first competition Leo Diegel passed away, we need to identify the year of his first win and the year of his death.

1. **Year of Death**: Leo Diegel died on May 5, 1951.

2. **First Professional Win**: The table does not specify the exact year of his first professional win. However, since he turned professional in 1916 and had 36 professional wins, we can infer that his first win likely occurred shortly after turning professional. For the sake of this calculation, let's assume his first win was in 1917, the year following his professional debut.

3. **Calculate the Years Between**: Subtract the assumed year of his first win from the year of his death:
   \[
   1951 - 1917 = 34
   \]

Therefore, Leo Diegel passed away 34 years after his first professional win.

","To determine how many years it took for inflation in France to decrease by 0.8%, we need to look at the inflation rates provided for different years:

- 2018: 2.1%
- 2019: 1.3%
- 2020: 0.5%

The decrease from 2018 to 2020 is calculated as follows:

\[ 2.1\% - 0.5\% = 1.6\% \]

The question asks for a decrease of 0.8%. We can see that the decrease from 2018 to 2019 is:

\[ 2.1\% - 1.3\% = 0.8\% \]

This decrease of 0.8% occurred over one year, from 2018 to 2019.

","To determine the number of years that elapsed from the beginning of Bayinnaung's reign as Suzerain of Lan Na to the end of his first reign as Suzerain of Lan Xang, we need to identify the start and end dates of these periods:

   - Date: 2 April 1558

2. **End of Bayinnaung's first reign as Suzerain of Lan Xang:**
   - Date: c. January 1568

Now, calculate the time elapsed between these two dates:

- From 2 April 1558 to 2 April 1567 is 9 years.
- From 2 April 1567 to c. January 1568 is approximately 9 months.

Therefore, the total time elapsed is 9 years and about 9 months.

","The orbiter's planned mission duration is approximately 7.5 years. The elapsed duration, as of the current date (December 2022), is 2 years and 10 months. To find out how many years longer the planned mission duration is compared to the elapsed duration, we need to convert the elapsed duration into years and then subtract it from the planned duration.

1. Convert the elapsed duration into years:
   - 2 years and 10 months is equivalent to 2 + (10/12) years.
   - 10 months is approximately 0.833 years (since 10/12 = 0.833).

2. Add the years and the fractional year:
   - 2 + 0.833 = 2.833 years.

3. Subtract the elapsed duration from the planned duration:
   - 7.5 years (planned) - 2.833 years (elapsed) = 4.667 years.

Therefore, the orbiter's planned mission duration is approximately 4.667 years longer than its current elapsed duration.
Final Answer: Approximately 4.667 years."

","To solve this problem, we need to calculate the duration of two historical periods and then find the difference between them.

1. **Period between the Rustamid and Zirid dynasties:**
   - Rustamid dynasty began in 776.
   - Zirid dynasty began in 972.
   - Duration = 972 - 776 = 196 years.

2. **Period between the Hammadid and Zayyanid dynasties:**
   - Hammadid dynasty began in 1015.
   - Zayyanid dynasty began in 1236.
   - Duration = 1236 - 1015 = 221 years.

3. **Difference in duration:**
   - Difference = 221 years (Hammadid to Zayyanid) - 196 years (Rustamid to Zirid) = 25 years.

Final Answer: 25 years."

","The Birmingham-Jefferson Convention Complex was renovated in 2009 and again from 2019 to 2021. 

- The first renovation occurred in 2009.
- The second renovation spanned from 2019 to 2021, which is a duration of 3 years (2019, 2020, and 2021).

To find how many years longer the second renovation was compared to the first, we calculate the difference in duration:

- The first renovation was a single year (2009).
- The second renovation lasted 3 years.

The difference in duration is 3 years (second renovation) - 1 year (first renovation) = 2 years.

['15 Blackburn Skua, Bristol Perseus (15650612347).jpg', 'Blackburn Skua in flight']

","To solve this, we need to calculate two time periods and find the difference between them:

1. **Time between the withdrawal from the front line and withdrawal from other duties:**
   - Withdrawn from the front line: 1941
   - Withdrawn from other duties: March 1945
   - Time period: 1945 - 1941 = 4 years

2. **Time between the first flight and introduction:**
   - First flight: 9 February 1937
   - Introduction: November 1938
   - Time period: From February 1937 to November 1938 is 1 year and 9 months.

Now, convert 1 year and 9 months into years:
- 9 months is 9/12 = 0.75 years
- Total time from first flight to introduction: 1 + 0.75 = 1.75 years

- **Hungary** was part of the Axis from 1944 to 1945, which totals 1 year.

Now, subtract the duration of Hungary's involvement from Italy's:

6 years (Italy) - 1 year (Hungary) = 5 years

","The first flight of the JF-17 Thunder was on 25 August 2003, and it was introduced on 12 March 2007. To find the number of years between these two dates, calculate the difference between 2007 and 2003, which is 4 years. However, since the introduction date (12 March 2007) is before the first flight date (25 August 2003) within the year 2007, we need to account for the months and days:

- From 25 August 2003 to 25 August 2006 is exactly 3 years.
- From 25 August 2006 to 12 March 2007 is an additional 6 months and 18 days.

Thus, the total time between the first flight and the introduction is 3 years, 6 months, and 18 days. In terms of years, this is slightly more than 3.5 years.

Final Answer: 3 years, 6 months, and 18 days (slightly more than 3.5 years)"

","The groundbreaking for the Carrier Dome took place on November 11, 1978, and it opened on September 20, 1980. To determine the number of years between these two dates, we calculate the time from November 11, 1978, to November 11, 1979, which is 1 year. Then, from November 11, 1979, to September 20, 1980, is an additional 10 months and 9 days. Since we are calculating in years, we consider the period from November 11, 1978, to September 20, 1980, as approximately 1 year and 10 months.

Final Answer: Approximately 1 year and 10 months."

","Mohammad-Ali Foroughi was a member of the Parliament of Iran from 19 November 1909 to 3 August 1921. To calculate the number of years he served, we need to determine the time span between these two dates.

1. Start date: 19 November 1909
2. End date: 3 August 1921

First, calculate the full years between 1909 and 1921:
- From 19 November 1909 to 19 November 1920 is 11 years.

Next, account for the additional time from 19 November 1920 to 3 August 1921:
- From 19 November 1920 to 19 November 1921 would be another full year, but we only go up to 3 August 1921.
- From 19 November 1920 to 3 August 1921 is 8 months and 15 days.

Therefore, the total time served is 11 years and approximately 8 months.

Final Answer: 11 years and 8 months."

","To determine the number of years between Belarus's independence from Russia and its independence from the USSR, we need to look at the relevant dates provided in the table:

1. Independence from Russia: 25 March 1918
2. Independence from the USSR: 25 August 1991

Now, calculate the number of years between these two dates:

- From 25 March 1918 to 25 March 1991 is 73 years.
- From 25 March 1991 to 25 August 1991 is an additional 5 months.

Therefore, the total time between independence from Russia and independence from the USSR is 73 years and 5 months.

","To determine how much longer Abdul Jeelani's NBA career was compared to his college career, we need to calculate the duration of each.

1. **College Career:**
   - Jeelani attended college from 1972 to 1976.
   - Duration: 1976 - 1972 = 4 years

2. **NBA Career:**
   - Jeelani's NBA career spanned from 1976 to 1979.
   - Duration: 1979 - 1976 = 3 years

Now, subtract the length of his college career from his NBA career:
- NBA career duration: 3 years
- College career duration: 4 years

Difference: 3 years (NBA) - 4 years (college) = -1 year

This means Jeelani's NBA career was 1 year shorter than his college career, not longer.

Final Answer: Jeelani's NBA career was 1 year shorter than his college career."

","Alessandro Riguccini was born on March 25, 1988. He began his career in 1999. To find out how old he was when he started his career, subtract the year he was born from the year he began his career: 1999 - 1988 = 11. Since his birthday is on March 25, and he began his career in 1999, he would have turned 11 on March 25, 1999. Therefore, he was 10 years old at the start of 1999 and turned 11 during that year.

1999 - 1955 = 44

Since the medal was awarded in 1999 and his birthday is on May 15, we need to check if he had already turned 44 by the time he received the award.

['Silver medal - second place | 1983 Rio de Janeiro | Team competition']

","Janice Lawrence Braxton was born on June 7, 1962. She won a silver medal at the FIBA World Championship for Women in Rio de Janeiro in 1983. To determine her age at that time, we calculate the difference between 1983 and 1962:

1983 - 1962 = 21

Since the event took place in 1983 and her birthday is on June 7, we need to check if the event occurred before or after her birthday in 1983. The FIBA World Championship for Women in 1983 took place from July 1 to July 11, which is after her birthday. Therefore, she had already turned 21 by the time of the event.

Final Answer: 21 years old"

2014 - 1995 = 19

Since his birthday is on November 7, and the specific date of his participation in the series is not provided, we consider two scenarios:

1. If he competed before November 7, 2014, he would still be 18 years old.
2. If he competed on or after November 7, 2014, he would be 19 years old.

Without the exact date of his participation, we can conclude that he was either 18 or 19 years old during the 2014 NASCAR PEAK Mexico Series.

Since the exact date of the 1988 Chamonix World Championships is not provided, we assume it occurred after her birthday on June 14, 1988. Therefore, she would have turned 24 on June 14, 1988.

","Pierre Auguste Cot was born on 17 February 1837 and died on 2 August 1883. To calculate his age at the time of his death, we need to consider the years, months, and days between these two dates.

1. Calculate the years: 1883 - 1837 = 46 years.
2. Since he died after his birthday in 1883, he had already turned 46 that year.

Therefore, Pierre Auguste Cot was 46 years old when he died.
Final Answer: 46 years old."

","Scottie Pippen was born on September 25, 1965. He won his first Olympic gold medal in the 1992 Barcelona Olympics. To determine his age at that time, we need to calculate the difference between 1992 and his birth year, 1965.

1992 - 1965 = 27

Since the Olympics took place in 1992 and his birthday is on September 25, we need to check if he had already turned 27 by the time of the Olympics. The 1992 Olympics were held from July 25 to August 9, 1992. Since July 25 is before his birthday on September 25, he was still 26 years old during the Olympics.

","Roy Emerson was born on November 3, 1936, and he retired in 1983. To find out how old he was when he retired, we need to calculate the difference between 1983 and 1936.

1983 - 1936 = 47

Since he retired in 1983 and his birthday is on November 3, if he retired before November 3, 1983, he would still be 46. However, if he retired on or after November 3, 1983, he would be 47. The table does not specify the exact date of retirement in 1983, but typically, retirement is considered at the end of the year unless otherwise noted.

Assuming he retired at the end of 1983, he would have turned 47 on November 3, 1983.

Final Answer: 47 years old"

Since his active duty started in 1940 and his birthday is on 20 July, we need to check if he had already turned 29 by the time he started active duty in 1940. If he started active duty before 20 July 1940, he would still be 28. If he started after 20 July 1940, he would be 29.

The table does not specify the exact date in 1940 when he began active duty, but typically, military service would start at the beginning of the year unless otherwise noted. Therefore, it is reasonable to assume he started active duty after his birthday in 1940.

","To determine Theo Bot's age at the time of his marriage, we need to know his birth date and the year he got married.

1. Theo Bot was born on 20 July 1911.
2. He married Elisabeth van Hal in 1936.

To find his age at marriage, subtract the year of birth from the year of marriage and consider if his birthday had occurred by the time of the marriage in 1936:

- Year of marriage: 1936
- Year of birth: 1911
- Age in 1936: 1936 - 1911 = 25

Since he was born on 20 July and the marriage took place in 1936, we need to check if the marriage occurred before or after 20 July 1936. The table does not specify the exact date of marriage in 1936, but since it is not mentioned that the marriage occurred after his birthday, we assume it happened before 20 July 1936.

Therefore, Theo Bot was 24 years old when he married Elisabeth van Hal.

","Thiago Alves was born on July 26, 1986. The Pan American Games in which he won gold took place in 2011. To find out how old he was at that time, we calculate the difference between 2011 and 1986:

2011 - 1986 = 25

Since the Pan American Games occurred before his birthday in 2011 (the games were held in October), he had not yet turned 25 that year. Therefore, he was 24 years old when he won gold in the Pan American Games in 2011.

- The 2012 Olympic Games were held from July 27 to August 12, 2012.
- Thiago Alves's birthday is July 26, 1986.

Since the games started on July 27, 2012, and his birthday was on July 26, 2012, he turned 26 on the day before the games began.

Therefore, Thiago Alves was 26 years old when he won his first Olympic medal in 2012.

2. From July 1, 1936, to September 26, 1936, is an additional 2 months and 25 days.

Therefore, Babe Young was 21 years old when he made his MLB debut.

","To determine how old Zumla was when he won the Mahathir Science Award, we need to know the year he received the award and his birth year.

1. Zumla was born on May 15, 1955.
2. He won the Mahathir Science Award in 2020.

To find his age in 2020, subtract his birth year from the award year:

2020 - 1955 = 65

Since the award was given in 2020 and his birthday is on May 15, by the time he received the award, he would have already turned 65 in May 2020.

","The planned mission duration for the Chandrayaan-2 orbiter was approximately 7.5 years. The elapsed time for the orbiter mission, as of the current date (December 2022), is 2 years and 10 months. To find the difference in years between the planned and elapsed mission durations, we need to convert the elapsed time into years and then subtract it from the planned duration.

1. Convert the elapsed time into years:
   - 2 years and 10 months is equivalent to 2 + (10/12) years.
   - 10 months is approximately 0.833 years (since 10/12 = 0.833).

2. Add the years and the fractional year:
   - 2 + 0.833 = 2.833 years.

3. Subtract the elapsed time from the planned duration:
   - 7.5 years (planned) - 2.833 years (elapsed) = 4.667 years.

Since the first crewed flight in April 1981 occurred before the anniversary of the first flight in August 1977, it is still within the same 4-year period.

Final Answer: 3 years and 8 months (or simply 3 years if considering only full years)"

Dolly Parton concert chronology

Backwoods Barbie Tour | (2008) | Better Day World Tour | (2011) | Blue Smoke World Tour | (2014)

","To find the average length of time between Dolly Parton's tours, we need to consider the years of the tours mentioned:

1. Backwoods Barbie Tour: 2008
2. Better Day World Tour: 2011
3. Blue Smoke World Tour: 2014

Calculate the time between each consecutive tour:

- From the Backwoods Barbie Tour (2008) to the Better Day World Tour (2011): 2011 - 2008 = 3 years
- From the Better Day World Tour (2011) to the Blue Smoke World Tour (2014): 2014 - 2011 = 3 years

Now, find the average of these intervals:

Average length of time between tours = (3 years + 3 years) / 2 = 6 years / 2 = 3 years

   - The earliest year listed for the Brazilian National Championship is 1996.

2. **Determine his birth year:**
   - Murilo Bustamante was born on July 30, 1966.

3. **Calculate his age in 1996:**
   - 1996 (year of first participation) - 1966 (birth year) = 30 years old.

4. **Check if he had already had his birthday in 1996 by the time of the championship:**
   - Since the championship is in Rio de Janeiro and his birthday is on July 30, if the championship was before July 30, 1996, he would still be 29. However, since the exact date of the championship is not provided, we assume it was after his birthday.

Now, let's calculate the gaps between these championship years:

1. 1999 - 1987 = 12 years
2. 2003 - 1999 = 4 years
3. 2007 - 2003 = 4 years
4. 2015 - 2007 = 8 years

","Percy Faith was born on April 7, 1908. The year in question is 1949. To find out how old he was in 1949, we subtract the birth year from 1949: 1949 - 1908 = 41. Since we are considering the year 1949 and his birthday is April 7, by the time he was at work in 1949, he would have already turned 41 on April 7, 1949.
Final Answer: 41 years old."
