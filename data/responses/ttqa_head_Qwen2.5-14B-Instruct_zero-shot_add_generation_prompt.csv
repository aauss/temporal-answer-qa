Website	www | .jeffreyepstein | .org

","To find out how many months passed between Jeffrey Epstein's apprehension and his death, we need to follow these steps:

1. Identify the date of apprehension:
   The table mentions that Jeffrey Epstein was apprehended on July 6, 2019 (for the second criminal case).

2. Identify the date of death:
   The table states that Jeffrey Epstein died on August 10, 2019.

3. Calculate the number of days between the two dates:
   - From July 6 to July 31: 25 days
   - Adding August 1 to August 10: 10 days
   Total: 25 + 10 = 35 days

4. Convert days into months:
   To convert days into months, we can use an approximation of 30 days per month:
   35 days / 30 days/month ≈ 1.17 months

Therefore, Jeffrey Epstein died approximately 1.17 months after being apprehended.

Final Answer: Approximately 1.17 months"

","To determine at what age Adolf von Baeyer received the Nobel Prize, we need to follow these steps:

1. Identify when he was born.
2. Identify when he received the Nobel Prize.
3. Calculate his age based on these dates.

Step 1: From the table, we can see that Adolf von Baeyer was born on 31 October 1835.

Step 2: The table also shows that he received the Nobel Prize for Chemistry in 1905.

Step 3: To calculate his age in 1905, we subtract his birth year from the year he received the Nobel Prize:
1905 - 1835 = 70 years old

However, we should consider the exact dates to be more precise. Since he was born on October 31st and received the Nobel Prize in 1905, if the prize was awarded before October 31st, he would have been 70; if after, he would turn 70 during that year. Given typical award schedules and the common practice of celebrating such achievements on or near the recipient's birthday, it is reasonable to conclude he received the prize shortly after turning 70.

Final Answer: Adolf von Baeyer received the Nobel Prize at the age of 70."

","To determine at what age Jeffrey Epstein got work release, we need to follow these steps:

1. Identify when Jeffrey Epstein received his sentence.
2. Find out the duration of his imprisonment.
3. Determine if work release was part of his penalty.
4. Calculate his age at the time he started work release.

Step 1: The information provided states that Epstein's criminal charge was ""Procuring an underage girl for prostitution; sex trafficking"" and his penalty was ""13 months with work release (2008)"".

Step 2: His sentence was for 13 months, which included work release.

Step 3: The penalty explicitly mentions work release, so it was indeed part of his sentence.

Step 4: To calculate Epstein's age when he started work release:
- Epstein was born on January 20, 1953.
- He received his sentence in 2008.

To find his age in 2008:
2008 - 1953 = 55 years old.

Since the exact start date of his imprisonment isn't specified, we can assume that he would have been approximately 55 years old when he began serving his sentence, and thus also when he started work release.

Final Answer: Jeffrey Epstein was approximately 55 years old when he got work release."

","To find out at what age Melissa L. Coates retired from wrestling, we need to follow these steps:

1. Identify her birth year from the ""Born"" information.
2. Identify the year she retired from wrestling.
3. Calculate the difference between her retirement year and her birth year.

Step 1: From the ""Born"" row of the table, we see that Melissa L. Coates was born on June 18, 1971.

Step 2: From the ""Retired"" row in the Professional wrestling career section, we see that she retired in 2020.

Step 3: To calculate her age when she retired:
- Subtract her birth year (1971) from her retirement year (2020).
- 2020 - 1971 = 49 years old

However, since her birthday is in June and she retired presumably before or after her birthday in 2020, we should consider whether she had already celebrated her birthday that year. Given she passed away on June 23, 2021, it can be assumed she had not yet turned 50 in 2020 when she retired.

Therefore, Melissa L. Coates was 49 years old when she retired from wrestling.

Final Answer: Melissa L. Coates retired from wrestling at the age of 49."

","To determine the age at which Roger Federer achieved his highest ranking, we need to follow these steps:

1. Identify Roger Federer's highest ranking.
2. Find out when he achieved this ranking.
3. Calculate his age at that time.

Step 1: Identifying the highest ranking
From the ""Singles"" section of the table:
""Highest ranking	No. | 1 | (2 February 2004)""

So, Roger Federer's highest ranking was No. 1, achieved on February 2, 2004.

Step 2: Finding out his birth year
From the ""Born"" row:
""Born	( | 1981-08-08 | ) | 8 August 1981 | (age 40) | Basel, Switzerland""

We know Roger Federer was born on August 8, 1981.

Step 3: Calculating his age
He reached his highest ranking on February 2, 2004. To calculate his age, we subtract his birth year from the year he reached his highest ranking:
2004 - 1981 = 23 years old

Since his birthday is August 8, and his highest ranking was achieved on February 2, he had already turned 23 years old at that point.

Final Answer: Roger Federer was 23 years old when he achieved his highest ranking of No. 1."

- Since the marriage happened in 1995 and he was born in 1942, we need to consider if his birthday had already passed in 1995. Given his birthday is in January and the year is 1995, we can assume his birthday had already occurred by the time of his marriage.
- Therefore, Stephen Hawking was 53 years old when he married Elaine Mason.

","To determine Tony Stewart's age when he was inducted into the NASCAR Hall of Fame, we need to follow these steps:

1. Find out when Tony Stewart was inducted into the NASCAR Hall of Fame.
2. Determine his birth year.
3. Calculate his age at the time of induction.

Step 1: From the table, under the ""Awards"" section, it states that Tony Stewart was inducted into the NASCAR Hall of Fame in 2020.

Step 2: The table provides his birth date as May 20, 1971.

Step 3: To calculate his age in 2020:
   - The year of induction is 2020.
   - His birth year is 1971.
   - Age = Year of induction - Birth year = 2020 - 1971 = 49 years old.

Since his birthday had already occurred in 2020 before the induction, he would have been 49 years old at the time of induction.

Final Answer: Tony Stewart was 49 years old when he was inducted into the NASCAR Hall of Fame."

Jurist term ends	16 October 2023

Deputy President
Currently	Uzi Vogelman
Since	9 May 2022
Lead position ends	16 October 2023
Jurist term ends	6 October 2024

","To find out how many more years Esther Hayut has been with the Supreme Court of Israel compared to Uzi Vogelman, we need to calculate their respective terms at the court and then compare them.

1. **Esther Hayut's Term**:
   - She became President on 26 October 2017.
   - Her lead position ends on 16 October 2023.
   - Time in office from 2017 to 2023: 2023 - 2017 = 6 years.
   - Considering her start date was mid-year (October), she hasn't completed the full 6 years yet as of December 2022. So, it's slightly less than 6 years but for simplicity, we can consider her tenure to be close to 6 years.

2. **Uzi Vogelman's Term**:
   - He became Deputy President on 9 May 2022.
   - His lead position ends on 16 October 2023.
   - As of December 2022, he has been in this role for less than one year since his start date was mid-year (May).

Now, let's compare the two terms:
- Esther Hayut's term ≈ 6 years.
- Uzi Vogelman's term ≈ 0.5 years (less than a year).

The difference in their terms is approximately:
\[ 6 \text{ years} - 0.5 \text{ years} = 5.5 \text{ years} \]

Final Answer: Esther Hayut has been with the Supreme Court of Israel for approximately 5.5 more years compared to Uzi Vogelman."

","To find out for how many more years Steve Austin was married to Jeanie Clarke compared to Kathryn Burrhus, we need to calculate the duration of each marriage and then subtract the shorter duration from the longer one.

First, let's determine the duration of Steve Austin's marriage to Kathryn Burrhus:
- He married Kathryn Burrhus in 1990.
- They were divorced in 1992.
Duration of marriage to Kathryn Burrhus = 1992 - 1990 = 2 years.

Next, let's determine the duration of his marriage to Jeanie Clarke:
- He married Jeanie Clarke in 1992.
- They were divorced in 1999.
Duration of marriage to Jeanie Clarke = 1999 - 1992 = 7 years.

Now, we can find out the difference between these two durations:
Difference = Duration of marriage to Jeanie Clarke - Duration of marriage to Kathryn Burrhus
Difference = 7 years - 2 years = 5 years.

Therefore, Steve Austin was married to Jeanie Clarke for 5 more years than he was to Kathryn Burrhus.

","To determine how many years Black Dog Siding operated under its original name, we need to identify two key pieces of information from the provided table:

1. The opening date of Black Dog Siding.
2. The date when it was renamed.

From the ""Key dates"" section of the table:
- Black Dog Siding opened on 3 November 1863.
- It was renamed to Black Dog Halt on 8 June 1953.

Now, let's calculate the number of years between these two dates:

1. From November 1863 to November 1952 is exactly 89 years.
2. Since it was renamed in June 1953, we need to subtract the period from January to May 1953 (which is approximately 5 months).

Therefore, we have 89 full years minus about 5 months of operation under the original name.

Since the question asks for the number of years, we can round down to the nearest whole year.

","To determine for how many years Access Hollywood was known simply as ""Access,"" we need to follow these steps:

1. Identify the period when the show was known as ""Access.""
2. Determine the start and end dates of this period.
3. Calculate the duration in years.

Step 1: From the information provided, we see that ""Also known as"" includes ""(2017-2019)"". This indicates the show had another name during this period.

Step 2: The table also mentions ""Also known as Access | (2017-2019)"", implying that before 2017, the show was known simply as ""Access.""

Since the show started on September 9, 1996, and it was known as ""Access"" up until 2017, we can conclude that it was known as ""Access"" from 1996 to 2016 (inclusive).

Step 3: To calculate the number of years:
2017 (the year it changed) - 1996 (the year it started) = 21 years total
However, since 2017 is not included in the period when it was called ""Access"", we subtract one year:
21 years - 1 year = 20 years

Final Answer: Access Hollywood was known simply as ""Access"" for 20 years."

Attributes	Bishop's attire

","To determine for how many years Alphonse Gallegos held both positions simultaneously, we need to follow these steps:

1. Identify the start and end dates for each position:
   - For Auxiliary Bishop of Sacramento: The table doesn't explicitly state when he started this role, but it's mentioned alongside his other titles.
   - For Titular Bishop of Sasabe: The term began on 24 August 1981 and ended on 6 October 1991.

2. Since the exact starting date for Auxiliary Bishop isn't provided, we assume that it began at the same time as his appointment as Titular Bishop of Sasabe, which is 24 August 1981.

3. Calculate the duration from the start date (24 August 1981) to the end date (6 October 1991):
   - From 24 August 1981 to 24 August 1991 is exactly 10 years.
   - Adding the partial year from 24 August 1991 to 6 October 1991 brings the total duration to slightly more than 10 years.

Therefore, Alphonse Gallegos served as both Auxiliary Bishop of Sacramento and Titular Bishop of Sasabe for approximately 10 years.

","To find out for how many years ""Atlantis"" was in publication, we need to determine the time span between its first publication and the most recent edition.

1. Identify the first publication year:
   - The first edition was published in 1984.

2. Identify the most recent publication year:
   - The most recent edition mentioned is the 30th Anniversary Edition from 2019.

3. Calculate the number of years in publication:
   - Subtract the first publication year from the most recent publication year.
   - 2019 (most recent) - 1984 (first) = 35 years

However, it's important to note that the question asks for the duration in publication, which implies continuous publication without necessarily accounting for the exact years when editions were not released. Given only the information about the editions provided, we can reasonably infer that there was some level of active publication or edition release spanning from 1984 to 2019.

In the ""Former names"" row, we can see:
Collegiate School (1701-1718) | Yale College (1718-present)

This indicates that Yale University was originally called Collegiate School from its establishment in 1701 until 1718.

Now, let's calculate the duration it was known as Collegiate School:
Ending year (1718) - Starting year (1701) = Duration

1718 - 1701 = 17 years

Therefore, Yale University was named Collegiate School for 17 years.

","First, we need to identify the years of marriage for both of Dick King-Smith's wives from the information provided:

1. First wife, Myrle: Married in 1943, until her death.
2. Second wife, Zona Bedding: Married in 2001, until his death.

","The question seems to have a discrepancy since the aircraft mentioned in the table is ""B-24 Skua,"" but there's no known aircraft called ""B-24 Skua."" The table details for the ""B-24"" and ""Skua"" appear to be mixed up, and given the information provided, it looks like we're dealing with the Blackburn Skua, not a B-24 Skua. 

To answer the question correctly, let's focus on the Blackburn Skua based on the data provided:

1. First flight of the Blackburn Skua: 9 February 1937
2. Withdrawal from other duties: March 1945

Now, calculating the time difference:
- From February 1937 to March 1945 is approximately 8 years and 1 month.

","To determine how many days after Ingenuity's deployment the picture was taken, we need to identify two dates:

1. The date when Ingenuity was deployed.
2. The date when the picture was taken.

From the History section:
- Deployed: 3 April 2021
- First flight: 19 April 2021, 07:34 UTC
- Last flight: 11 June 2022, 15:06 UTC

The picture was taken on 7 April 2021, which can be inferred from the ""First flight"" date being 19 April 2021 and the fact that the picture must have been taken before this date for Ingenuity to be ready for its first flight. Since the picture is described as taken on ""April 7, 2021,"" it is reasonable to conclude this is the date in question.

Now, calculate the difference between these two dates:
- Deployment date: April 3, 2021
- Picture taken date: April 7, 2021

The difference is 4 days.

","To find out how many days Ingenuity flew on Mars, we need to calculate the duration between its first and last flights.

From the given data:
- First flight: 19 April 2021, 07:34 UTC
- Last flight: 11 June 2022, 15:06 UTC

Step 1: Calculate the total number of days between these two dates.
- From 19 April 2021 to 30 April 2021: 12 days
- May 2021 has 31 days
- June 2021 up to 11 June 2021: 11 days
- Add the days from January 2022 to May 2022: 31 + 28 + 31 + 30 + 31 = 151 days (accounting for February being a non-leap year month in 2022)

Total days = 12 + 31 + 11 + 151 = 195 + (days in June 2022 until 11 June 2022)
- Days in June 2022 until 11 June 2022: 11 days

So, total days = 195 + 11 = 206 days

However, since we're interested only in the period when Ingenuity was operational, we need to subtract the initial deployment date (3 April 2021) from the first flight date (19 April 2021).

Step 2: Subtract the 16 days before the first flight.
- Days from 3 April 2021 to 18 April 2021: 16 days

Therefore, the actual operational period is 206 - 16 = 190 days.

Final Answer: Ingenuity flew on Mars for 190 days."

- August: Full month = 31 days
- September: Full month = 30 days
- October: Full month = 31 days
- November: Full month = 30 days
- December: Days until December 25 = 25 days

Now let's add these days together:

- Start Date: 24 August 1981

","To determine how long Ambrose Rayappan served as Archbishop Emeritus of Pondicherry and Cuddalore from 1953, we need to identify when his term as Archbishop ended and whether he was immediately given the title of Archbishop Emeritus afterward.

From the information provided:
- His term as Archbishop ended on 17 March 1973.
- He died on 24 November 1999.

The term ""Emeritus"" usually indicates that someone continues to hold a title after retirement or cessation of active service. However, the exact date when he became Archbishop Emeritus isn't directly stated in the table. Since the term ""Emeritus"" is listed in the category section along with his name, it's reasonable to infer that he held this honorary title from the end of his term as Archbishop until his death.

Therefore:
- His term as Archbishop ended in 1973.
- We can assume he became Archbishop Emeritus in 1973.
- He died in 1999.

So, he served as Archbishop Emeritus for approximately 26 years (from 1973 to 1999).

Final Answer: Ambrose Rayappan served as Archbishop Emeritus of Pondicherry and Cuddalore for about 26 years."

Key dates
3 November 1863	Opened as | Black Dog Siding
8 June 1953	Renamed | Black Dog Halt
20 September 1965	Closed

","To determine how long Black Dog Siding remained open, we need to identify its opening and closing dates.

From the table:
- Black Dog Siding was opened on 3 November 1863.
- It was renamed to Black Dog Halt on 8 June 1953.
- The station was closed on 20 September 1965.

The period during which it was known as Black Dog Siding ended when it was renamed to Black Dog Halt. Therefore, we consider the renaming date as the end of the ""Black Dog Siding"" era.

Now, let's calculate the duration:
- Start date: 3 November 1863
- End date: 8 June 1953

To make the calculation easier, we can approximate both dates to the nearest year:
- 3 November 1863 is approximately 1863
- 8 June 1953 is approximately 1953

Subtracting these gives us:
1953 - 1863 = 90 years

Therefore, Black Dog Siding remained open for approximately 90 years.

","Firstly, we need to identify the period when Miloš Obrenović I ruled Serbia, and specifically the time when he succeeded Karađorđe.

From the table:
- Miloš Obrenović I became Grand Vožd of Serbia on 23 April 1815.
- He succeeded Karađorđe as Grand Vožd of Serbia.
- He later transitioned from being Grand Vožd to becoming Prince of Serbia on 6 November 1817.

To calculate the duration of his reign starting from when he succeeded Karađorđe:
- Starting date: 23 April 1815
- Ending date: 25 June 1839 (end of his reign as Prince of Serbia)

Now, let's calculate the number of years between these dates.

From 23 April 1815 to 25 June 1839:
- From 23 April 1815 to 23 April 1839 is 24 years.
- Adding the partial year from 23 April 1839 to 25 June 1839 gives us an additional part of the 25th year.

Thus, the total duration is 24 full years plus part of the 25th year.

Final Answer: Miloš Obrenović I's reign lasted approximately 24 years after succeeding Karađorđe."

The table states that the ""Inception"" date for the Kalmar Union was ""17 June 1397"".

Step 2: Identify the end date.
From the historical timeline provided, the dissolution of the Kalmar Union can be inferred to have occurred in 1537 when it's mentioned that ""Denmark-Norway was established"". This suggests the Kalmar Union ceased to exist around this time.

Step 3: Calculate the duration.

","The information provided states that the song ""21st Century Breakdown"" was recorded between 2008 and 2009. To find out how long the recording took, we need to determine the difference between these two years.

Step 3: Calculate the duration.

However, since the recording took place over parts of both 2008 and 2009, and not just from January 1, 2008, to December 31, 2009, we should clarify that it's likely less than a full year but more than a few months given the specific months mentioned for release and recording.

","To determine how long the second renovation of the Birmingham-Jefferson Convention Complex lasted, we need to identify the start and end dates of the second renovation period mentioned in the table.

From the table, under the ""Renovated"" row, it states: ""2009, 2019-21"". This indicates there were two separate renovation periods; the first one was in 2009, and the second one was from 2019 to 2021.

The second renovation started in 2019 and ended in 2021. To calculate the duration, we subtract the start year from the end year:
2021 - 2019 = 2 years

Therefore, the second renovation lasted for 2 years.

Final Answer: 2 years"

","To determine how long AT&T had been known by a different name, we need to consider the periods mentioned under ""Formerly"" and the founding date of AT&T Inc.

1. The company was known as Southwestern Bell Corporation from 1983 to 1995.
2. Then it was called SBC Communications Inc. from 1995 to 2005.
3. AT&T Inc. was founded on October 5, 1983.

Now let's calculate the duration:

- From 1983 to 1995, that's 12 years.
- From 1995 to 2005, that's another 10 years.
- Total time under different names = 12 + 10 = 22 years.

Final Answer: AT&T had been known by a different name for 22 years."

","To determine how long the Salvadoran Civil War had been going on when North Korea withdrew its diplomatic support, we need to follow these steps:

1. Identify the start date of the Salvadoran Civil War.
2. Identify when North Korea withdrew its support.
3. Calculate the duration between these two dates.

Step 1: The start date of the Salvadoran Civil War is given as 15 October 1979.

Step 2: According to the information provided, North Korea's diplomatic support lasted until 1990.

Step 3: To calculate the duration:
From 15 October 1979 to 1990:
- From 15 October 1979 to 15 October 1990 is exactly 11 years.
- Since North Korea withdrew support in 1990, it would be slightly less than 11 full years.

Therefore, the war had been going on for just under 11 years when North Korea withdrew its support.

Final Answer: Just under 11 years"

","To determine how long Belarus has been under its current Constitution, we need to identify when the current constitution was formed and calculate the time elapsed up to December 2022.

1. From the table, we can see that the ""Current constitution"" was formed on 15 March 1994.
2. Now, we need to calculate the duration from 15 March 1994 to December 2022.
3. First, let's calculate the number of full years from 15 March 1994 to 15 March 2022:
   - 2022 - 1994 = 28 years
4. Since we're considering the period up to December 2022, we need to account for the additional months beyond March:
   - From 15 March 2022 to December 2022 is less than a full year, so we do not count another full year.

Therefore, Belarus has been under its current Constitution for 28 years as of December 2022.

","To determine how long Rudolf Thienel has been the President of the Supreme Administrative Court, we need to follow these steps:

1. Identify the start date of Rudolf Thienel's term as President.
2. Determine the current date.
3. Calculate the difference between the current date and the start date.

Step 1: According to the information provided, Rudolf Thienel became the President on 1 January 2014.

Step 2: The current date is given as December 2022.

Step 3: To calculate the duration, we subtract the start year from the current year:
- Current year (2022) minus Start year (2014) = 8 years

However, since Rudolf Thienel started his term in January 2014 and it is currently December 2022, he has not yet completed the full 8 years as of now. Therefore, the duration is 8 years minus the partial year that hasn't been fully completed yet.

Final Answer: Rudolf Thienel has been President for 8 years (as of December 2022, but not yet completed the full 8 years)."

From the information provided in the table:
- The State Transport Authority brand was formed on July 1, 1983.
- As a statutory corporation, V/Line was formed on October 1, 2003.

Since the question asks about V/Line being a corporation, we should consider the later date, which is October 1, 2003.

Now, let's calculate the duration from October 1, 2003, to December 2022:

1. From October 1, 2003, to October 1, 2022, is exactly 19 years.
2. From October 1, 2022, to December 2022 is an additional 2 months and 30 days, but since we're asked for the duration in years, we can approximate this as less than one year.

Therefore, V/Line has been a corporation for approximately 19 years as of December 2022.

","To determine how long the church has been open in total, we need to calculate the periods when it was open and sum them up.

1. The church was originally founded in the 13th century, but no specific year is given for its founding.
   - We don't have a precise start date for the first period of operation.

2. It closed from 1873 to 1949.
   - This means it was not open during this period, which lasted 76 years (1949 - 1873).

3. After being consecrated on 31 July 1949, it became operational again.
   - From 1949 until the current date (December 2022), the church has been open.
   - Duration since reopening = 2022 - 1949 = 73 years.

Since the exact founding year isn't specified, we can only accurately account for the time after the closure period. Therefore, the total time the church has been open since it was consecrated in 1949 is 73 years.

Final Answer: The church has been open for a total of 73 years since it was consecrated in 1949."

2. However, the table also mentions that AT&T Inc. was formerly known as Southwestern Bell Corporation from 1983 to 1995 and then as SBC Communications Inc. from 1995 to 2005.
3. The current name, AT&T Inc., was adopted after the merger with SBC Communications Inc. in 2005.

Given that the logo often changes during mergers or rebranding events, it is reasonable to assume that the current logo was introduced around the time of the rebranding to AT&T Inc. in 2005.

Since the current date is given as December 2022, we can calculate the duration the current logo has been in use:

2022 - 2005 = 17 years

Therefore, the current AT&T logo has been in use for approximately 17 years.

Final Answer: The current AT&T logo has been in use for about 17 years."

From the table:

Now, let's calculate the duration:

1. Start Date: 29 April 1912
2. End Date: 26 March 1942

We need to consider both the year difference and whether the end date comes before or after the start date within the same year. 

- From 29 April 1912 to 26 March 1942 spans across 29 years and 10 months and 27 days (since 26 March is before 29 April).

Thus, he served for approximately 29 years and 10 months. However, since the question asks for the duration in years, we'll round down to the nearest whole number.

Final Answer: Alojzije Mišić was the Bishop of Mostar-Duvno and Apostolic Administrator of Trebinje-Mrkan for 29 years."

","To determine how long Arnold Schwarzenegger served as the governor of California, we need to look at the dates provided for his term in office.

From the information given:
- Arnold Schwarzenegger began his term as the 38th Governor of California on November 17, 2003.
- He ended his term on January 3, 2011.

Now, let's calculate the duration of his term:

1. Calculate the number of complete years he was in office:
   - From November 17, 2003, to November 17, 2010, is exactly 7 years.

2. Determine if there were additional days in his term beyond these 7 years:
   - Since he left office on January 3, 2011, which is within the first month of 2011, this means he served part of the year 2011 as well.
   
Therefore, adding up the complete years and considering the partial year:
- Total time in office = 7 years + part of 2011.

Since we're asked for the length in years, we can round down to the nearest whole year or acknowledge it's more than 7 but less than 8 full years.

Final Answer: Arnold Schwarzenegger was the governor of California for 7 years plus some extra days into the 8th year."

2. Check for Prime Ministers:
   There is no information about any Prime Ministers listed in the table.

3. Reinterpret the question:
   Given the lack of Prime Minister information, we need to consider if José Manuel de Herrera could have been a Prime Minister during his time as Emperor.

4. Analyze the government structure:
   The government type is described as a Federal parliamentary constitutional monarchy, which typically doesn't have a Prime Minister position.

5. Look at the timeline:
   The empire existed from 1821-1823.
   José Manuel de Herrera served as Emperor from 1822-1823.

6. Conclusion:
   There's no evidence that José Manuel de Herrera was ever Prime Minister of the Mexican Empire. He was Emperor, not Prime Minister.

","To determine how long Nate Archibald's career lasted since 1970, we need to look at his playing career timeline provided in the table.

1. The table indicates that Nate Archibald's playing career started in 1970.
2. His career ended in 1984, as stated under ""Playing career"".

Now, let's calculate the duration:

","To determine how long Probe was in production, we need to look at the earliest and latest publication dates provided in the information given.

The earliest publication date mentioned is 1964, specifically for editions numbered #112 and #200. The latest publication date mentioned is 1976, for edition #202. However, it's important to note that the ""Years active"" field states from 1964 to 1982, which means the game continued to be available until 1982 even though the last new edition was published in 1976.

","To determine how long Richard Caswell was married to his wife, we need to identify which marriage period we should focus on, as he had more than one spouse. Given that the question asks about ""his wife"" without specifying a particular marriage, we'll consider the longest marriage period provided.

From the information given:
- He married Mary Mackilwean in 1752 and she died in 1757.
- Then he married Sarah Herritage in 1758.

Since there's no end date for his marriage to Sarah Herritage, we'll assume the question is asking about this longer-term relationship.

The start year of his marriage to Sarah Herritage is given as 1758. Since there's no specific end date, we can't calculate an exact duration, but if the question implies asking about the longest known marriage, it would be from 1758 onwards.

However, if we interpret the question as asking about the duration of any marriage he had a record of ending, the most suitable option would be his marriage to Mary Mackilwean.

Mary Mackilwean:
Marriage start year: 1752
Death year: 1757

Duration = Death year - Marriage start year = 1757 - 1752 = 5 years

Therefore, Richard Caswell was married to Mary Mackilwean for 5 years.

Final Answer: Richard Caswell was married to Mary Mackilwean for 5 years."

","To determine how long V/Line was branded as an Authority, we need to identify two key dates from the information provided:

1. When did V/Line become the State Transport Authority?
   - According to the table, V/Line became the State Transport Authority brand on 1 July 1983.

2. When did V/Line transition from being a statutory corporation to something else (implying it no longer was branded as solely an Authority)?
   - The table states that V/Line transitioned into a statutory corporation on 1 October 2003.

However, the phrasing of the question asks about the period when V/Line was branded as an Authority. Since the table mentions V/Line becoming a statutory corporation on 1 October 2003, this suggests that prior to this date, it was indeed branded or operated under an Authority framework.

Therefore, the duration during which V/Line was branded as an Authority would be from 1 July 1983 until 1 October 2003.

Now, let's calculate the number of years:

From 1 July 1983 to 1 October 2003:
- From July 1983 to June 2003 is exactly 20 years.
- Adding the additional 3 months from July to October 2003 gives us a total of 20 years and 3 months.

Since the question specifically asks for the time in years, we can round down to the nearest whole year, giving us 20 years.

","To determine how long Valen Chapel was in operation after its completion, we need to look at two key pieces of information from the table:

1. The year it was completed.
2. The period when it was closed.

From the ""Specifications"" section:
- Completion Year: 1707

From the ""History"" section:
- Closed: 1873-1949

The chapel's operational period can be calculated based on these dates. However, since it was closed for a specific period (1873-1949), we need to consider its active periods separately.

First, calculate the time from completion to the first closure:
1707 to 1873 = 1873 - 1707 = 166 years

Next, calculate the time from reopening to the final closure:
1949 - 1873 = 76 years

Adding both periods together gives us the total operational time:
166 years + 76 years = 242 years

Final Answer: Valen Chapel was in operation for 242 years after its completion."

2. First T20I: The table also states that Sri Lanka's first T20I was played against England on 15 June 2006.

[""Consolidated PBV-1A Catalina '433915' Miss Pick Up (G-PBYA).jpg"", 'A restored OA-10 Catalina in US Army Air Corps colors']

","To determine how long the PBY Catalina was in commission by the US Navy, we need to identify two key dates: its introduction and retirement from service.

From the information provided:
- The PBY Catalina was introduced to the United States Navy in October 1936.
- It was retired by the United States Navy Reserve in January 1957.

Now, let's calculate the duration it served:
1. Start year: 1936
2. End year: 1957
3. Subtract start year from end year: 1957 - 1936 = 21 years

However, since the exact months aren't specified for both dates, we'll consider only full years for simplicity. Given that it was introduced in October and retired in January, we can assume it served almost the full years between these two dates.

Final Answer: The PBY Catalina was in commission by the US Navy for approximately 21 years."

","To find out how many days after being laid down INS Trishul was launched, we need to follow these steps:

1. Identify the date when INS Trishul was laid down.
2. Identify the date when INS Trishul was launched.
3. Calculate the difference between these two dates.

Step 1: The date when INS Trishul was laid down is given as 24 September 1999.

Step 2: The date when INS Trishul was launched is given as 24 November 2000.

Step 3: To calculate the difference between these two dates, we can break it down into months and then convert those months into days:
- From 24 September 1999 to 24 September 2000 is exactly one year, which is 365 days (since 1999 is not a leap year).
- From 24 September 2000 to 24 November 2000 is two months.
- We'll consider each month to have approximately 30 days for simplicity, so two months would be around 60 days.

Adding these together:
365 days + 60 days = 425 days

Therefore, INS Trishul was launched 425 days after it was laid down.

","To find out how many days passed between the first flight of the X-15 and its introduction, we need to calculate the number of days from June 8, 1959, to September 17, 1959.

Step 1: Calculate the remaining days in June.
June has 30 days, so from June 8 to June 30:
\[ 30 - 8 = 22 \text{ days} \]

Step 2: Add the days in July.
July has 31 days, so:
\[ 31 \text{ days} \]

Step 3: Add the days in August.
August has 31 days, so:
\[ 31 \text{ days} \]

Step 4: Add the days until September 17.
From September 1 to September 17:
\[ 17 \text{ days} \]

Step 5: Sum up all the days.
\[ 22 + 31 + 31 + 17 = 101 \text{ days} \]

Final Answer: The X-15 was introduced 101 days after its first flight."

['Forty ninth parallel (1941).jpg | Original Belgian film poster']

","To determine how many days after the London premiere the movie premiered in New York, we need to calculate the difference between the two dates.

From the table, we can see that:
- The UK premiere (London premiere) was on 8 October 1941.
- The US premiere (New York City premiere) was on 5 March 1942.

Let's break down the calculation:

1. Calculate the number of days remaining in October after the 8th:
   - October has 31 days.
   - Days left in October after the 8th = 31 - 8 = 23 days.

2. Add the days in November:
   - November has 30 days.
   - Total days so far = 23 + 30 = 53 days.

3. Add the days in December:
   - December has 31 days.
   - Total days so far = 53 + 31 = 84 days.

4. Add the days from January up to February:
   - January has 31 days.
   - February has 28 days in 1942 (not a leap year).
   - Total days so far = 84 + 31 + 28 = 143 days.

5. Count the days in March up to the 5th:
   - Up to the 5th in March = 5 days.
   - Total days = 143 + 5 = 148 days.

Therefore, the movie premiered in New York 148 days after its London premiere.

","To determine how many days after the groundbreaking the construction was completed, we need to know both the groundbreaking date and the completion date. The table provides us with the groundbreaking date but not a specific completion date. However, it does give us the consecration date, which typically marks the official completion and opening of a church for worship.

Step 1: Identify the groundbreaking date.
The groundbreaking date is given as 11 July 1939.

Step 2: Identify the completion/consecration date.
The consecration date, which we can reasonably assume as the completion date, is given as 9 November 1940.

Step 3: Calculate the number of days between these two dates.
From 11 July 1939 to 9 November 1940:
- From 11 July 1939 to 31 December 1939: 
  - Days remaining in July: 20 (since 31 - 11 + 1 = 21, and we don't count the start day twice)
  - Full months of August, September, October: 31 + 30 + 31 = 92
  - Total for 1939: 20 + 92 + 31 = 143 days
- From 1 January 1940 to 9 November 1940:
  - Full months of January, February, March, April, May, June, July, August, September: 
    - Considering leap year (1940 was a leap year), the total for these months is 31 + 29 + 31 + 30 + 31 + 30 + 31 + 31 + 30 = 274 days
  - Days in October: 31
  - Days from 1 November to 9 November: 9
  - Total for 1940 up to 9 November: 274 + 31 + 9 = 314 days

Total days from groundbreaking to consecration: 143 + 314 = 457 days

Final Answer: The construction of All Hallows Twickenham was completed 457 days after the groundbreaking on 11 July 1939."

","To find out how many days longer the period between the aftershocks was compared to the foreshocks, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of days between the first foreshock and the main earthquake.
2. Calculate the number of days between the first aftershock and the main earthquake.
3. Subtract the number of days from step 1 from the number of days from step 2.

Step 1: The first foreshock occurred on 23 February 1960, and the main earthquake happened on 29 February 1960. The difference in days is:
29 February - 23 February = 6 days

Step 2: The first aftershock occurred on 22 March 1960. To calculate the number of days from 29 February to 22 March, we need to consider that February has 29 days in a leap year:
Number of remaining days in February after 29 February = 0
Number of days in March up to 22 March = 22
Total days between the main earthquake and the first aftershock = 0 + 22 = 22 days

Step 3: Subtract the number of days between the foreshock and the main earthquake from the number of days between the aftershock and the main earthquake:
22 days (aftershock period) - 6 days (foreshock period) = 16 days

Therefore, the period between the aftershocks was 16 days longer than the period between the foreshocks.

First, let's identify the dates:
- Launch date: 22 July 2019
- Landing date: 6 September 2019

Step 1: Calculate the number of days from July 22 to July 31.
July has 31 days, so from July 22 to July 31 is 31 - 22 = 9 days.

Step 2: Add the days in August.
August has 31 days, so that's 31 days.

Step 3: Calculate the number of days from September 1 to September 6.
From September 1 to September 6 is 6 days.

Step 4: Sum up all the days.
Total days = Days in July + Days in August + Days in September
           = 9 + 31 + 6

","To determine how many days the 14 On Fire tour was shown in 2014, we need to consider the start and end dates provided:

1. The start date of the tour is given as 21 February 2014.
2. The end date of the tour is given as 22 November 2014.

We can calculate the number of days by considering the total span from the start date to the end date. However, since the question asks specifically for the number of days it was ""shown,"" which typically refers to the duration of performances rather than the exact count of days, we can infer that the number of days refers to the period during which concerts were held.

Let's break down the calculation:
- From February 21 to November 22, 2014, includes several months.
- We need to add up the days in each month from February to November and include only the relevant days in February and November.

However, the question can be interpreted more simply by understanding that the number of days refers to the inclusive range from the start date to the end date.

Therefore, we calculate:
- Start Date: February 21, 2014
- End Date: November 22, 2014

This period spans multiple months, but the specific number of days isn't directly provided in the data. Given the typical interpretation of such questions, we can conclude that the number of days the tour was active is from the start date to the end date, inclusive.

Thus, the number of days the tour was active is from February 21 to November 22, which is the entire period mentioned.

Final Answer: The 14 On Fire tour was active for the entire period from February 21 to November 22, 2014."

Let's break it down into two parts: from April 27, 1951, to December 31, 1951, and from January 1, 1952, to April 3, 1952.

1. Days from April 27, 1951, to December 31, 1951:
   - April: 30 days - 27 days = 3 days
   - May to December: 31 + 30 + 31 + 30 + 31 + 30 + 31 + 30 + 31 = 275 days
   - Total for 1951: 3 + 275 = 278 days

2. Days from January 1, 1952, to April 3, 1952:
   - January: 31 days
   - February: 28 days (assuming it's not a leap year)
   - March: 31 days
   - April: 3 days
   - Total for 1952: 31 + 28 + 31 + 3 = 93 days

Adding both periods together:
278 days + 93 days = 371 days

Therefore, Mohammad Yamin served as Minister of Law for 371 days.

","To determine how many days the 12th Annual Honda Civic Tour was held, we need to calculate the number of days between the start date (August 1, 2013) and the end date (October 6, 2013).

Step 1: Identify the dates.
Start date: August 1, 2013
End date: October 6, 2013

Step 2: Count the days in August from August 1 to August 31.
There are 31 days in August, so from August 1 to August 31 there are 31 - 1 + 1 = 31 days (we add 1 because we count both the start and end day).

Step 3: Count the days in September.
September has 30 days.

Step 4: Count the days in October up to October 6.
From October 1 to October 6 there are 6 days.

Step 5: Add up all the days.
Total days = Days in August + Days in September + Days in October
           = 31 + 30 + 6
           = 67 days

Therefore, the 12th Annual Honda Civic Tour was held over 67 days.

Final Answer: The 12th Annual Honda Civic Tour was held for 67 days."

","To find out how many days the Better Day World Tour was held in 2011, we need to determine the duration between its start and end dates.

The start date of the tour is July 17, 2011, and the end date is December 1, 2011. 

Let's calculate the number of days between these two dates:

1. Count the remaining days in July after July 17:
   - July has 31 days.
   - Days from July 18 to July 31 = 31 - 17 = 14 days.

2. Count all the days in August, September, October, and November:
   - August: 31 days
   - September: 30 days
   - October: 31 days
   - November: 30 days
   - Total for these months = 31 + 30 + 31 + 30 = 122 days

3. Count the days in December up to and including December 1:
   - December 1 is included, so it's 1 day.

4. Add up all these days:
   - Days remaining in July: 14
   - Days in August, September, October, and November: 122
   - Days in December: 1
   - Total = 14 + 122 + 1 = 137 days

Therefore, the Better Day World Tour lasted for 137 days in 2011.

","To determine how many full months the 14 On Fire concert tour spanned, we need to follow these steps:

1. Identify the start and end dates of the tour.
   - Start date: 21 February 2014
   - End date: 22 November 2014

2. Calculate the number of months between the start and end dates:
   - From February to November is a period of 9 months.
   - However, since the tour started mid-month (February 21st) and ended mid-month (November 22nd), we should check if both starting and ending months are considered fully included in the tour.
   
3. Consider whether both starting and ending months are counted as full months:
   - February is not fully included because the tour started on the 21st.
   - November is not fully included because the tour ended on the 22nd.
   
Since neither the start month (February) nor the end month (November) are fully included in the count of full months, the tour spans only the months from March through October, which totals 8 full months.

1. Ordination date: 16 December 1923.
2. Consecration date: 25 March 1953.

Now, let's calculate the number of years that passed from December 1923 to March 1953.

- From December 1923 to December 1952 is exactly 29 years.
- Since the consecration occurred in March 1953, which is after December 1952, we add one more year to the total.

Therefore, the total number of full years that passed between his ordination and consecration is 29 + 1 = 30 years.

","To determine how many months after INS Trishul was ordered it was officially commissioned, we need to calculate the time difference between the order date and the commission date.

Step 1: Identify the order date.
The order date for INS Trishul is given as 17 November 1997.

Step 2: Identify the commission date.
The commission date for INS Trishul is given as 25 June 2003.

Step 3: Calculate the number of months between these two dates.
- From 17 November 1997 to 17 November 2003 is exactly 6 years.
- Since the commission date is 25 June 2003, we need to count the remaining months from 17 November 2003 to 25 June 2003 in reverse:
  - From 17 November 2003 to 17 December 2003 is 1 month.
  - From 17 December 2003 to 25 June 2003 is 6 months (December + January + February + March + April + May + part of June).

So, the total time between 17 November 1997 and 25 June 2003 is 6 years and 6 months.

Step 4: Convert the time into months.
- 6 years = 6 * 12 months = 72 months.
- Adding the extra 6 months gives us a total of 78 months.

Final Answer: INS Trishul was officially commissioned 78 months after it was ordered."

1. Identify the date of Epstein's arrest.
2. Identify the date of Epstein's death.
3. Calculate the time difference in months.

Step 1: Date of Arrest
From the table, the date of Epstein's arrest is given as July 6, 2019.

Step 2: Date of Death
The table provides the date of death as August 10, 2019.

Step 3: Calculate Time Difference
- From July 6 to July 31: 25 days in July (since he was arrested on July 6)
- Full month of August: 31 days

Total days = 25 + 10 = 35 days

Now, convert 35 days into months:
35 days / 30.44 (average number of days per month) ≈ 1.15 months

Since we're asked for the number of months and typically such questions expect a whole number, we can round this to the nearest whole number, which is 1 month.

However, it's important to note that the actual period spans more than one month but less than two. For precise answers, we might consider it as 1 month and some extra days.

","To find out how many months after its launch INS Trishul was officially commissioned, we need to calculate the difference between the dates of its launch and commissioning.

From the table:
- Launched: 24 November 2000
- Commissioned: 25 June 2003

First, let's determine the number of months between these two dates:

1. From November 2000 to November 2003 is exactly 3 years.
2. Each year has 12 months, so 3 years is 3 * 12 = 36 months.
3. From November 2003 to June 2003 is 6 months (December, January, February, March, April, May).

Adding these together:
36 months + 6 months = 42 months

However, since the launch date is on the 24th of November and the commissioning date is on the 25th of June, we need to subtract one month because it wasn't commissioned until the next month after November 2003.

Therefore, the total time from launch to commissioning is 42 - 1 = 41 months.

1. Identify the release dates:
   - New York City premiere: 5 March 1942
   - United States general release: 15 April 1942

2. Calculate the time difference between these two dates:
   - From 5 March to 15 April:

","The Plan of Iguala took place on 24 February 1821, and the Independence of Mexico occurred on 28 September 1821.

To calculate the number of months between these two dates, we can follow these steps:
1. Count the number of full months from February to August: This is 7 months (March, April, May, June, July, August).
2. Add the days in February and September: The independence happened later in the year than the plan was set, specifically from the end of February to the end of September. This means we have to add the entire month of September.
3. Thus, the total is 7 months plus the additional month of September for the full cycle to be completed, which gives us 7 + 1 = 8 months.

Final Answer: 8 months"

","To find out how many months after the UK nationwide release the US nationwide release was, we need to follow these steps:

1. Identify the UK nationwide release date from the given information.
2. Identify the US nationwide release date from the given information.
3. Calculate the difference between the two dates in terms of months.

Step 1: The UK nationwide release date is listed as 24 November 1941.

Step 2: The US nationwide release date is listed as 15 April 1942.

Step 3: Calculating the difference:
- From November 24, 1941, to December 31, 1941: 6 days (since there are 6 days left in November).
- Adding the full months from January to April 1942: 3 months (January, February, March).

Therefore, from November 24, 1941, to April 15, 1942, is a total of 3 months and 27 days.

Since we're asked for the number of months, we'll consider it as approximately 4 months (as the 27 extra days are close to a month).

","To find out how many months after the beginning of his reign as King of Burma was Bayinnaung's coronation in Toungoo, let's follow these steps:

1. Identify the start of Bayinnaung's reign:
   The table shows that Bayinnaung's reign began on 30 April 1550.

2. Identify the date of Bayinnaung's coronation in Toungoo:
   The table mentions that Bayinnaung was crowned on 11 January 1551 in Toungoo.

3. Calculate the time difference between the start of the reign and the Toungoo coronation:
   From 30 April 1550 to 11 January 1551:
   - April has 30 days, so from 30 April to 30 April = 0 days
   - May has 31 days
   - June has 30 days
   - July has 31 days
   - August has 31 days
   - September has 30 days
   - October has 31 days
   - November has 30 days
   - December has 31 days
   - January has 11 days until 11 January

   Total days = 0 + 31 + 30 + 31 + 31 + 30 + 31 + 30 + 31 + 11 = 276 days

4. Convert days into months:
   Assuming an average month length of 30.44 days (365.25 days/year ÷ 12 months/year):
   276 days ÷ 30.44 days/month ≈ 9.07 months

Rounding to the nearest whole number, we get approximately 9 months.

Final Answer: Bayinnaung's coronation in Toungoo occurred about 9 months after the beginning of his reign as King of Burma."

","To find out how many months after the first crewed flight the last flight was, we need to follow these steps:

1. Identify the dates of the first crewed flight and the last flight.
2. Calculate the difference between these two dates in terms of months.

Step 1: Identifying the Dates
- First crewed flight: STS-1 on April 12, 1981
- Last flight: STS-135 on July 21, 2011

Step 2: Calculating the Difference in Months
- From April 12, 1981 to April 12, 2011 is exactly 30 years.
- From April 12, 2011 to July 21, 2011 is 3 months and 9 days.

Therefore, the total time from the first crewed flight to the last flight is 30 years and 3 months and 9 days. Since the question asks for the number of months, we can convert the years into months and add the remaining months:

30 years * 12 months/year = 360 months
360 months + 3 months = 363 months

Since the question only asks for the number of months and not the exact number of days, we do not need to account for the extra 9 days.

Final Answer: 363 months"

Number built	3
['Black rocket aircraft with stubby wings and short vertical stabilizers above and below tail unit', 'The X-15 pulling away from its drop launch plane']

","To find out how many months after the first flight the X-15 was introduced, we need to calculate the difference between the dates of these two events.

1. First Flight Date: 8 June 1959
2. Introduction Date: 17 September 1959

We can break down the calculation into steps:
- From June 8th to June 30th: 30 - 8 = 22 days remaining in June.
- July has 31 days.
- August has 31 days.
- From September 1st to September 17th: 17 days.

Now, let's add up all these days:
22 (remaining days in June) + 31 (days in July) + 31 (days in August) + 17 (first 17 days of September) = 101 days.

Next, convert the total number of days into months. Since there are approximately 30 days in a month, we can divide the total number of days by 30:
101 days / 30 ≈ 3.37 months.

Since we typically measure such durations in whole months for simplicity in this context, we'll round this to the nearest whole number, which is 3 months.

Final Answer: The X-15 was introduced about 3 months after its first flight."

","To determine how many months after the first foreshock the last aftershock occurred, we need to follow these steps:

1. Identify the date of the first foreshock.
2. Identify the date of the last aftershock.
3. Calculate the difference between these two dates in months.

Step 1: The first foreshock occurred on 23 February 1960.

Step 2: The last aftershock mentioned occurred on 17 April 1960.

Step 3: Calculating the difference:
- From 23 February to 31 March = 37 days (since February has 29 days in 1960)
- Adding the days from 1 April to 17 April = 17 days
- Total days = 37 + 17 = 54 days

Since there are approximately 30 days in a month, we can estimate this as roughly 1 month and 24 days. However, since the question asks for the number of months, we will round up to the nearest whole month.

Therefore, the last aftershock occurred about 2 months after the first foreshock.

1. The launch date is given as 22 July 2019.
2. The landing date is given as 6 September 2019.

Now, let's break down the calculation:

- From July 22 to July 31: 9 days
- Full month of August: 31 days
- From September 1 to September 6: 6 days

Adding up these periods:
- July remaining days: 9 days
- August full month: 31 days
- September days until landing: 6 days

Total days = 9 + 31 + 6 = 46 days

Since there are approximately 30 days in a month on average, we can convert the total days into months:
- 46 days ≈ 1.53 months (46 / 30)

Therefore, the moon lander's landing date occurred approximately 1.5 months after the launch date.

- From February 2021 to December 2021 is 11 months.
- Adding the full year from January 2022 to December 2022 is 12 months.

Therefore, the total number of months from February 2021 to December 2022 is:

","To find out how many months are left in the Mars Express mission duration, we need to follow these steps:

1. Identify the total mission duration given.
2. Calculate the elapsed time from the start of the mission until now (December 2022).
3. Subtract the elapsed time from the total mission duration to get the remaining time.

Step 1: The total mission duration provided is ""19 years and 1 month since launch"".

Step 2: We know that the mission started on June 2, 2003, and it's currently December 2022. To calculate the elapsed time:
- From June 2, 2003, to June 2, 2022, is exactly 19 years.
- From June 2, 2022, to December 2022 is 6 months.

So, the elapsed time is 19 years and 6 months.

Step 3: Subtract the elapsed time from the total mission duration:
- Total mission duration: 19 years and 1 month
- Elapsed time: 19 years and 6 months
- Remaining time: (19 - 19) years + (1 - 6) months = 0 years - 5 months = -5 months

Since the result is negative, it indicates that the mission has already exceeded its initial projected duration. Thus, there are no months left in the original mission duration; however, the spacecraft continues to operate beyond its planned timeframe.

Final Answer: There are 0 months left in the originally planned mission duration, but the spacecraft continues to operate beyond its initial timeframe."

Singles from |  14 Shades of Grey
['""Price to Play"" | Released: April 1, 2003 | ""So Far Away"" | Released: June 17, 2003 | ""How About You"" | Released: December 23, 2003 | ""Zoe Jane"" | Released: April 5, 2004']

","To find out how many months before ""Price to Play"" the single ""How About You"" was released, we need to follow these steps:

1. Identify the release dates for both singles.
2. Calculate the difference between these dates.

From the provided information:
- ""Price to Play"" was released on April 1, 2003.
- ""How About You"" was released on December 23, 2003.

Now, let's calculate the time difference:

1. From April 1, 2003, to May 1, 2003, is one month.
2. From May 1, 2003, to June 1, 2003, is two months.
3. Continuing this process up to December 1, 2003, gives us eight more months.
4. Adding the days from December 1, 2003, to December 23, 2003, does not affect the monthly count significantly since we're only asked about months.

Therefore, ""How About You"" was released approximately 8 months after ""Price to Play"".

Final Answer: ""How About You"" was released 8 months after ""Price to Play""."

['Black rocket aircraft with stubby wings and short vertical stabilizers above and below tail unit', 'The X-15 pulling away from its drop launch plane']

","To find out how many months separated the introduction of the X-15 from its first flight, we need to calculate the difference between these two dates.

1. First Flight Date: 8 June 1959
2. Introduction Date: 17 September 1959

Let's break down the calculation month by month starting from the first flight date:

- From June 8 to June 30: 22 days (June has 30 days)
- July: 31 days
- August: 31 days
- From September 1 to September 17: 17 days

Now, let's add up all the days:
- June: 22 days
- July: 31 days
- August: 31 days
- September: 17 days

Total number of days = 22 + 31 + 31 + 17 = 101 days

Next, convert the total number of days into months. Since a typical month is considered to have around 30 days:

101 days / 30 days/month ≈ 3.37 months

Therefore, approximately 3.37 months separate the first flight from the introduction date.

Final Answer: Approximately 3.37 months."

","To find out how many months Theo Bot served as Ambassador to Austria, we need to identify his start and end dates for this position.

From the table, we can see that Theo Bot held the position of Ambassador of the Netherlands to Austria. However, the exact start and end dates for this particular role are not provided directly. Instead, the table gives us the term for another ambassadorial role:

""Ambassador of the Netherlands to Canada"" from ""17 January 1968 - 1 July 1973""

Since the specific term for his ambassadorship to Austria is not given, we cannot determine the exact number of months he served in that capacity based on the information provided in the table.

Final Answer: The table does not provide the specific dates for Theo Bot's term as Ambassador to Austria, so it's impossible to calculate the number of months served based on the given data."

Casualties and losses
['~400,000-579,000 killed | ~1,200,000 deaths from famine']

","First, let's identify the periods when Libya supported each side:

For the EPRDF:
The table shows Libya supported the EPRDF from 1985 to 1991.
This is a period of 1991 - 1985 = 6 years.

For the Derg/PDR Ethiopia:
Libya supported the Derg from 1977 to 1985.
This is a period of 1985 - 1977 = 8 years.

Now we compare these two durations:
6 years (for EPRDF) vs 8 years (for Derg/PDR Ethiopia).

To find how many more years Libya supported the EPRDF compared to the Derg/PDR Ethiopia, we subtract:
8 years - 6 years = 2 years.

However, since the question asks for how many more years Libya supported the EPRDF, and we found that Libya actually supported the other side (Derg/PDR Ethiopia) longer, the correct interpretation is that Libya did not support the EPRDF for more years, but rather for 2 years less.

Final Answer: Libya did not support the EPRDF for more years, but rather for 2 years less. Therefore, the answer to ""how many more years"" is 0, as the EPRDF was not supported for more years by Libya."

  - Duration = 15 years

- **Professional Years**: From 1968 to 1983.
  - Duration = 1983 - 1968 + 1 (including both 1968 and 1983)
  - Duration = 16 years

","To determine how many years passed between Alojzije Mišić's ordination as a priest and his appointment as the Bishop of Mostar-Duvno and Apostolic Administrator of Trebinje-Mrkan, we need to identify two key dates from the provided information:

1. Date of priestly ordination:
   - From the ""Ordination history"" section, we see that Alojzije Mišić was ordained on 7 July 1882.

2. Date of appointment as Bishop:
   - The ""Appointed"" row in the main table shows that he was appointed on 29 April 1912.

Now, let's calculate the number of years between these two dates:

1. From 7 July 1882 to 7 July 1912 is exactly 30 years.
2. Since his appointment date (29 April 1912) is later than his birthday in 1912, we need to add one more year to account for the period from 7 July to 29 April.

Therefore, the total number of years from his ordination to his appointment as Bishop is 30 + 1 = 31 years.

","To determine how many years passed between Anthony Pollina becoming the Senate Progressive Leader and Randy Brock becoming the Senate Minority Leader, we need to look at the dates associated with these roles in the provided information.

1. Anthony Pollina became Senate Progressive Leader on January 6, 2011.
2. Randy Brock became Senate Minority Leader on January 6, 2021.

Now, let's calculate the difference between these two dates:

","To find out how many years passed between when INS Trishul was ordered and when it was launched, we need to look at the dates provided for these two events:

1. Ordered: 17 November 1997
2. Launched: 24 November 2000

We can calculate the difference between these two dates:

- From 17 November 1997 to 17 November 2000 is exactly 3 years.
- From 17 November 2000 to 24 November 2000 is 7 days.

Since we're looking for the number of years, we can consider that the additional 7 days do not complete another full year. Therefore, the total time from ordering to launching is 3 years and 7 days, which we round down to 3 years since the question asks for years.

Mother	Višnja Urošević
Religion	Serbian Orthodox

","To determine how many years passed between Miloš Obrenović's reign as Grand Vožd and his second reign as Prince of Serbia, we need to identify the dates for each period of rule:

1. **Reign as Grand Vožd of Serbia**: 
   - Start: 23 April 1815
   - End: 6 November 1817

2. **Second Reign as Prince of Serbia**:
   - Start: 6 November 1817 (Note: The first reign as Prince of Serbia began on 6 November 1817 as well, but it ended on 25 June 1839. After this, he resumed the title of Prince of Serbia starting again from 6 November 1817, which means his second reign as Prince began immediately after his term as Grand Vožd.)

Since his second reign as Prince of Serbia started immediately after his term as Grand Vožd ended, there were no intervening years between these two periods of rule.

Therefore, the number of years after Miloš Obrenović's reign as Grand Vožd of Serbia ended until his second reign as Prince of Serbia began is 0.

Step 2: The United States Navy Reserve retired the PBY Catalina in January 1957.

Step 3: To calculate the number of years between these two dates:
From 1935 to 1957 is 22 years. However, since the retirement happened in January 1957, it's less than a full year from the first flight in March 1935. Therefore, the correct calculation should consider only complete years, which means the PBY Catalina served for 21 full years before being retired by the United States Navy Reserve.

1. Identify Rudolph's first appearance year.
2. Find the year Rusty was introduced.
3. Calculate the difference between these two years.

Step 1: From the table, we see that Rudolph's first appearance was in 1939.

Step 2: Rusty is mentioned in the ""Family"" section under ""Holidaze: The Christmas That Almost Didn't Happen"". Since this movie is not specified with a release year in the given data, we can reasonably infer that it's a later production since it includes modern elements like cell phones which weren't common until the late 1990s or early 2000s. For precision, let's consider it was released around 2005, a typical year for such holiday movies.

Step 3: Subtract Rudolph's first appearance year from the approximate year Rusty was introduced:

2. **Franklin D. Roosevelt**:

","First, let's identify when Max Aaron achieved his personal best score in the short program:
- Short program personal best score: 87.03
- Achieved at: 2015 Tallinn Trophy

Next, we need to find out when Max Aaron retired:
- Retirement date: April 19, 2018

Now, let's calculate the number of years between these two events:
- Achievement year: 2015
- Retirement year: 2018

To find the difference, subtract the earlier year from the later year:
2018 - 2015 = 3 years

Therefore, Max Aaron retired 3 years after achieving his personal best score in the short program.

Website	www | .jeffreyepstein | .org

","To find out how many years passed between Jeffrey Epstein's first penalty and his second apprehension, we need to identify both dates and calculate the difference.

First, let's identify the dates:
1. First penalty: The penalty is described as ""13 months with work release (2008)"". Since the exact start date isn't provided, we can assume it ended around late 2008 or early 2009. For this calculation, we'll use January 1, 2009, as a close approximation of when the penalty ended.
2. Second apprehension: The date given is July 6, 2019.

Now, we need to calculate the number of years between these two dates:
- From January 1, 2009, to January 1, 2019, is exactly 10 years.
- From January 1, 2019, to July 6, 2019, is approximately 6 months and 6 days.

Since we're asked for the number of years, we'll consider the full years only:
- 10 years have fully passed from 2009 to 2018.
- An additional partial year has passed from January 1, 2019, to July 6, 2019.

Therefore, Jeffrey Epstein was apprehended approximately 10 years and 6 months after his first penalty ended.

Final Answer: Jeffrey Epstein was apprehended approximately 10 years and 6 months after his first penalty."

","To determine how many years after his term as Archbishop Emeritus of Pondicherry and Cuddalore Ambrose Rayappan died, we need to follow these steps:

1. Identify when Ambrose Rayappan's term as Archbishop ended.
2. Identify when Ambrose Rayappan died.
3. Calculate the difference between these two dates.

Step 1: Ambrose Rayappan's term as Archbishop ended on 17 March 1973.

Step 2: Ambrose Rayappan died on 24 November 1999.

Step 3: Calculating the difference:
From 17 March 1973 to 17 March 1999 is exactly 26 years.
Adding the remaining days from 17 March 1999 to 24 November 1999:
- From 17 March to 31 December is 251 days.
- From 1 January to 24 November is 321 days.
Total extra days = 251 + 321 = 572 days, which is approximately 1 year and 175 days (since 365 days make a year).

Therefore, the total time difference is roughly 27 years and 175 days.

Since the question asks for the number of years, we can say it is approximately 27 years.

Now, let's calculate the difference between these two dates:

- First flight: 25 August 2003
- Start of production in Pakistan: January 2008

The period between August 2003 and January 2008 spans nearly 4 years and 5 months. However, since the question asks for the number of years, we'll consider the full years only:

- From August 2003 to July 2007 is exactly 4 years.
- Adding January 2008 makes it more than 4 years but less than 5 years.

Since the question asks specifically about the number of years, and the production started within the fifth year after the first flight, we round up to 5 years.

1. Identify the launch date of the vessel when it was still named Admiral Gorshkov.
2. Identify the commissioning date of INS Vikramaditya.
3. Calculate the difference between these two dates.

Step 1: The launch date of Admiral Gorshkov (which later became INS Vikramaditya) was 1 April 1982.

Step 2: The commissioning date of INS Vikramaditya was 16 November 2013.

Step 3: Calculate the difference:
From 1 April 1982 to 1 April 2013 is 31 years.
From 1 April 2013 to 16 November 2013 is approximately 7 months and 15 days.
Since we're looking for the number of years, we'll consider the full years only.

","To determine how many years passed between the release of ""3 a.m. Eternal"" on Pure Trance 2 and its release in the KLF vs ENT version, we'll follow these steps:

1. Identify the release dates:
   - Pure Trance 2 release: May 1989
   - KLF vs ENT version release: January 1992

2. Calculate the difference in years:
   - From May 1989 to December 1989: ~8 months
   - From January 1992 to December 1992: 12 months
   - Total years: 1992 - 1989 = 3 years
   - However, since it wasn't released until January 1992 (after 2 full years had passed), we subtract the partial year:
     3 years - 2 years (fully elapsed) = 1 year + remaining months from 1989 and additional months till January 1992

3. Considering only full years for simplicity, as typically asked in such questions:
   - We have 2 full years (from May 1989 to April 1991) plus an additional year (from May 1991 to January 1992).

Therefore, the number of full years that passed is 2 years and 8 months, but typically we consider full years, which makes it 2 years plus an additional year since the next full release was in January of the following year.

Final Answer: 2 years and 8 months, but typically considered as 3 years if counting full years elapsed. For standard answers, it's often rounded to 3 years."

","To find out how many years passed between Mohammad Yamin's term as the 8th Minister of National Education and his term as the 14th Minister of Information, we need to follow these steps:

1. Identify the dates for both positions.
2. Calculate the time difference between these dates.

Step 1: Identifying the dates:
- For the 8th Minister of National Education, he was in office from 30 July 1953 to 12 August 1955.
- For the 14th Minister of Information, he was in office from 6 March 1962 to 17 October 1962.

Step 2: Calculating the time difference:
- He left his position as the 8th Minister of National Education on 12 August 1955.
- He took office as the 14th Minister of Information on 6 March 1962.

Now let's calculate the number of years between these two dates:

From 12 August 1962 to 6 March 1962 is approximately 6 months and 24 days (considering the period before his official start date).

However, since we're looking at the time span between leaving one position and taking another, we consider the period from when he left the first position until he started the second position, which is mainly the 6 years and 11 months, plus a few extra days that are not significant in calculating the number of full years.

","To determine how many years after opening the stadium was renovated, we need to follow these steps:

1. Identify the opening date of the stadium.
2. Identify the renovation date of the stadium.
3. Calculate the difference between the renovation date and the opening date.

Step 1: The opening date of the stadium is given as 12 September 1926.

Step 2: The renovation date of the stadium is provided as 5 December 2009.

Step 3: To calculate the difference:
- From September 12, 1926, to September 12, 2009, is 83 years.
- Since the renovation happened on December 5, 2009, which is about 2 months and 23 days after September 12, 2009, we add one more year to account for the full year passed since the opening anniversary.

Therefore, the stadium was renovated 84 years after it opened.

1. Identify the opening date of the stadium.
2. Identify the renovation date of the stadium.
3. Calculate the difference between the renovation date and the opening date.

Step 1: The opening date of the stadium is given as 12 September 1926.

Step 2: The renovation date of the stadium is given as 5 December 2009.

Step 3: To calculate the difference:
- From 12 September 1926 to 12 September 2009 is exactly 83 years.
- From 12 September 2009 to 5 December 2009 is 2 months and 23 days.
  
Since we're looking for the number of years and not the exact day count, we can approximate this additional period as roughly 2/12 = 1/6 of a year or approximately 0.17 years.

Adding these together:
83 years + 0.17 years ≈ 83.17 years

Therefore, the stadium was renovated about 83.17 years after it opened.

Final Answer: The stadium was renovated approximately 83.17 years after it opened. For simplicity, we could round this to 83 years if only whole numbers are required."

- Renaming date: 1 February 1925 to Cheltenham Spa Malvern Road.

Now, calculate the time difference between these two dates:
- From 1908 to 1925 is 17 years.
- Since the renaming happened on 1 February 1925 and the opening was on 30 March 1908, we need to account for the partial year. However, since the question asks for the number of years and not the exact months, we can consider the full years only.

Therefore, the station was renamed 17 years after its original opening.

","To determine how many years after recording began ""21st Century Breakdown"" was released, let's follow these steps:

1. Identify when the recording started:
   The recording period is given as 2008-2009.
   
2. Identify the release date:
   The release date for ""21st Century Breakdown"" is December 21, 2009.

3. Calculate the duration of recording:
   Since the recording period spans from 2008 to 2009, it began sometime in 2008.

4. Determine the time difference between the start of recording and the release date:
   - If we assume that the recording began at the start of 2008 (January 1, 2008), then the song was released about 2 years later in December 2009.
   - However, since the exact start date within 2008 isn't specified, we can only be certain that it took less than two full years if it began mid-year or later.

Given the information provided, the most precise statement we can make is that ""21st Century Breakdown"" was released less than one year after the end of 2008, but since recording likely started early in 2008, we can reasonably conclude it took approximately one year from the beginning of the recording period until its release.

","The question asks for the number of years between the French occupation and Algeria's independence.

From the table:
- The French occupation began on 5 July 1830.
- Independence was achieved on 5 July 1962.

To calculate the duration:
1. Subtract the start year from the end year: 
   1962 - 1830 = 132 years

Therefore, the number of years between the French occupation and independence is 132.

","To determine how many years have passed since the Men's 4 × 200 metre freestyle relay at the Games of the XXXI Olympiad until the next related event, we need to follow these steps:

1. Identify the year of the Games of the XXXI Olympiad mentioned in the table.
2. Find information about the next related event, which could be another Olympics or another significant competition.
3. Calculate the difference in years between the two events.

Step 1: From the table, it is clear that the Games of the XXXI Olympiad refers to the Rio 2016 Olympics, where the Men's 4 × 200 metre freestyle relay took place on August 9, 2016.

Step 2: Looking through the table, there is no direct mention of the next related event. However, the table mentions ""← 2012 | 2020 →"", indicating that there were previous and subsequent Olympic games for this event. Since we are looking for the next event after 2016, we should consider the 2020 Olympics.

Step 3: Now we calculate the difference in years between the two events:
- The event in question is from 2016.
- The next mentioned Olympics is in 2020.
- Subtracting the earlier year from the later year gives us the number of years between them: 2020 - 2016 = 4 years.

Therefore, the next related event occurred 4 years after the Men's 4 × 200 metre freestyle relay at the Games of the XXXI Olympiad.

","The question requires us to find out how many years the elections were deferred after the Myanmar coup d'état. From the table, we can extract the following relevant information:

1. The 2020 general election took place before the coup.
2. The coup d'état occurred on 1 February 2021.
3. New elections have been deferred to August 2023.

Now let's calculate the deferral period:

- The coup happened on 1 February 2021.
- Elections were deferred to August 2023.

From February 2021 to February 2023 is two years.
Adding the remaining months from February 2023 to August 2023:
February + March + April + May + June + July + August = 7 months.

Since 7 months is less than a year, it does not add another full year to the count.

Therefore, the elections were deferred for 2 years and 7 months after the coup d'état.

Final Answer: The elections were deferred for 2 years and 7 months after the Myanmar coup d'état."

2. Identify the year of the first flight.
3. Subtract the start year from the first flight year.

Step 1: The table mentions that the Space Shuttle program's duration was from 1972 to 2011. We can infer that 1972 is the start year of the program.

Step 2: According to the table, the first flight (ALT-12) took place on August 12, 1977.

Step 3: To calculate the number of years between the start of the program and the first flight:
   1977 (first flight) - 1972 (start of program) = 5 years

Therefore, the first flight occurred 5 years after the Space Shuttle program began.

Next, we need to find out when PDR Ethiopia became a belligerent. From the ""Belligerents"" section, we can see that PDR Ethiopia appears under the Derg side, listed as ""(1987-1991)"". This means that PDR Ethiopia became a belligerent in 1987.

Now, we calculate the difference between these two dates:
- Start of the war: September 12, 1974
- PDR Ethiopia became a belligerent: 1987

The difference is 1987 - 1974 = 13 years.

- However, since the monarchy was abolished on 21 March 1975, which is later than 16 July 1975, we need to add one more year to account for the partial year.

Therefore, the total duration is 44 + 1 = 45 years.

Final Answer: 45 years"

","To find out how many years passed between the release of the first edition and the fifth edition of Catan in 1995, we need to follow these steps:

1. Identify the release year of the first edition.
2. Identify the release year of the fifth edition.
3. Calculate the difference between these two years.

Step 1: The release year of the first edition is given as 1995.

Step 2: The release year of the fifth edition is given as June 2015.

Step 3: Calculating the difference:
From 1995 to 2015 is a span of 20 years.

Therefore, the fifth edition was released 20 years after the first edition.

However, there's a slight confusion in the question itself since it asks for the number of years after the first edition was released in 1995, but the fifth edition was released in 2015, not 1995. So, based on the provided information and the correct interpretation, the answer should be 20 years.

How many years after the first flight was the B-24 Skua introduced?,1,aircraft,226,<num_years>,years,head,"category
aircraft

B-24 Skua
Role	Carrier-based dive bomber/fighter | Type of aircraft
Manufacturer	Blackburn Aircraft
First flight	9 February 1937
Introduction	November 1938
Retired	1941 (withdrawn from front line) | March 1945 (withdrawn from other duties)
Primary user	Fleet Air Arm
Number built	192
Variants	Blackburn Roc
['15 Blackburn Skua, Bristol Perseus (15650612347).jpg', 'Blackburn Skua in flight']

","The problem requires us to calculate the number of years between the first flight of the B-24 Skua and its introduction into service.

1. The first flight of the B-24 Skua took place on 9 February 1937.
2. The B-24 Skua was introduced in November 1938.

To find the number of years between these two dates:
- From February 1937 to February 1938 is one year.
- From February 1938 to November 1938 is less than one full year, so we count it as part of the second year.

Therefore, the total time elapsed is one full year plus a fraction of another year, which rounds up to 1 year and 10 months, approximately 2 years if considering whole years.

However, since the question asks for how many years, we should consider only the full years that have passed.

Final Answer: 1 year"

['Fairey Firefly FR.1 Z2030 Ringway 04.46 edited-2.jpg', 'Operational FAA Fairey Firefly FR.1 wearing late World War II camouflage']

","To find out how many years after the first flight the Firefly was retired, we need to follow these steps:

1. Identify the date of the first flight.
2. Identify the retirement date.
3. Calculate the difference between these two dates.

Step 1: The Firefly's first flight was on 22 December 1941.

Step 2: The Firefly was retired in 1956 according to the table.

Step 3: To calculate the difference:
- From 22 December 1941 to 31 December 1941 is approximately 30 days.
- From 1 January 1942 to 31 December 1955 is 14 full years.
- Adding the remaining time in 1956 until it was retired, which would be less than a year.

So, the total time from the first flight to retirement is 14 years plus a fraction of a year in 1956. Since we're asked for the number of years, we can say it was retired around 14 or 15 years after its first flight, but more precisely, it was about 14 years and some months.

Final Answer: Approximately 14 years."

","To find out how many years after the first launch at the Satish Dhawan Space Centre did the first launch from its second launch pad occur, we need to follow these steps:

1. Identify the date of the first launch at the Satish Dhawan Space Centre.
2. Identify the date of the first launch from the Second Launch Pad.
3. Calculate the difference between these two dates.

Step 1: The first launch at the Satish Dhawan Space Centre was on 9 August 1979, as stated in the ""Launch history"" section.

Step 2: The first launch from the Second Launch Pad occurred on 5 May 2005, as mentioned in the ""Second Launch Pad launch history"" section.

Step 3: Calculating the difference:
- From 9 August 1979 to 5 May 2005 involves calculating the number of years between these two dates.
- First, calculate the full years between 9 August 1979 and 9 August 2005: 26 years.
- Then, account for the days between 9 August 2005 and 5 May 2005. Since May comes before August, we subtract one year: 25 years.
- Now, count the days: From 9 August 2004 to 5 May 2005 is less than a year, so it doesn't affect the year count.

Therefore, the first launch from the Second Launch Pad occurred 26 - 1 = 25 years and some months after the first launch at the Satish Dhawan Space Centre.

However, since we're asked for the number of years, and the difference is more than 25 but less than 26 years, we can safely say it's 25 years plus a few months.

- The last election took place on October 20, 2018.
- The next election is scheduled for October 15, 2022.

Now, let's calculate the time difference between these two dates.

1. From October 20, 2018, to October 20, 2022, is exactly 4 years.
2. However, the next election is on October 15, 2022, which is 5 days before October 20, 2022.

Since the question asks for the number of years, we consider full calendar years rather than exact day counts. Thus, the next election in October 2022 occurs within the same calendar year as the start of the period we're measuring from October 2018, meaning it falls in the fourth year.

Therefore, the next election will take place 4 years after the last one.

","To find out how many years after the launch of INS Trishul it was commissioned, we need to look at the dates for both events.

From the table:
- The launch date of INS Trishul is given as 24 November 2000.
- The commissioning date of INS Trishul is given as 25 June 2003.

Now, let's calculate the time difference between these two dates.

1. First, determine the difference in years:
   - From 2000 to 2003 is exactly 3 years.

2. Next, we need to consider the specific months and days to see if there's any partial year involved:
   - Launch date: 24 November 2000
   - Commissioning date: 25 June 2003

Since the commissioning date falls before the same month and day of the launch date in the following year, we do not count an additional year. Therefore, the exact number of years remains 3.

Step 2: To calculate the number of years between 1984 and December 2022:
- From 1984 to 2022 is 2022 - 1984 = 38 years.

Since it's currently December 2022, the year 1984 is already past, so we don't need to adjust for the month.

Final Answer: Dick King-Smith won the Guardian Prize 38 years ago."

","To determine how many years ago Robby Gordon first won the Stadium Super Trucks, we need to follow these steps:

1. Identify the year Robby Gordon started his Stadium Super Trucks career.
2. Identify the year he won his first Stadium Super Trucks race.
3. Calculate the difference between those two years.

Step 1: Identifying the debut year
From the table, under ""Stadium Super Trucks career,"" it states that Robby Gordon's ""Debut season"" was in 2013.

Step 2: Identifying the year of his first win
Looking at the same section, we see that he has ""Wins: 29."" However, the specific year for his first win isn't directly mentioned. We should look for clues elsewhere in the table. Under ""Championship titles,"" it lists ""2013-2014 Stadium Super Trucks,"" which suggests he was successful early in his career. Since the question asks about his first win, and he won championships in 2013 and 2014, it's reasonable to infer that his first win occurred around or soon after his debut in 2013.

Step 3: Calculating the difference
Since Robby Gordon debuted in 2013 and likely won his first race not long after, we can reasonably estimate his first win also happened in 2013.

Now, to find out how many years ago this was from the current date (December 2022):
2022 - 2013 = 9 years

Therefore, Robby Gordon first won the Stadium Super Trucks 9 years ago from December 2022.

- First, count the full years from 1992 to 2022, which gives us 30 years.
- Since we are currently in December 2022 and the war ended in January 1992, we have not yet reached the next January, so no additional year needs to be added.

","To determine how many years ago the Western Sahara War ended, we need to follow these steps:

2. Calculate the number of years since that date until December 2022.

Step 1: The table indicates that the ceasefire was agreed upon between the Polisario Front and Morocco on 6 September 1991. Since this is considered the end of the conflict, we'll use this date for our calculation.

Step 2: Calculate the difference between the current date (December 2022) and the end date of the war (September 1991).

From September 1991 to September 2022 is 31 years. Since it's now December 2022, we've already passed the September mark, so we're 31 years into the future from the war's end.

Therefore, the Western Sahara War ended 31 years ago.

College Basketball Hall of Fame | Inducted in 2006

","To determine how many years ago Nate Archibald was inducted into the Basketball Hall of Fame, we need to follow these steps:

1. Identify when Nate Archibald was inducted into the Basketball Hall of Fame from the provided information.
2. Calculate the difference between the current year (December 2022) and the year he was inducted.

Step 1: The table mentions that Nate Archibald is in the Basketball Hall of Fame as a player, but it does not specify the exact year of his induction. We need to find another source or make an assumption based on the available data. However, typically, such information would be directly stated if known.

Since the specific year is not mentioned in the given data, we can't calculate the exact number of years since his induction. But for the sake of answering the question, let's consider the closest relevant information which is his induction into the College Basketball Hall of Fame in 2006.

Step 2: Calculate the difference between the current year (2022) and the year of his College Basketball Hall of Fame induction (2006).

2022 - 2006 = 16 years

However, this is not his induction into the Basketball Hall of Fame, but since we don't have the exact date of his induction into the main hall of fame, we cannot provide an accurate answer.

Final Answer: The exact number of years since Nate Archibald was inducted into the Basketball Hall of Fame cannot be determined from the given information. However, he was inducted into the College Basketball Hall of Fame in 2006, which is 16 years ago as of December 2022."

","First, let's clarify that the question contains an error. The INS Vikramaditya was never decommissioned in the Soviet Union or Russia; it was originally built for the Soviet Navy as Admiral Gorshkov but was sold to India before being commissioned into the Indian Navy as INS Vikramaditya. Therefore, there is no decommissioning event for this vessel in the Soviet Union or Russia.

However, if we're looking for the decommissioning date of its time in the Soviet Union, the information provided states that the ship was decommissioned in 1996 when it was still named Admiral Gorshkov.

To calculate how many years ago this happened from the current date (December 2022):

1. Decommissioning year: 1996
2. Current year: 2022
3. Subtract the decommissioning year from the current year: 2022 - 1996 = 26 years

1. Identify the formation date of the V/Line Corporation from the information provided.
2. Calculate the number of years between the formation date and the current date (December 2022).

Step 1: Identifying the formation date
The table states that the V/Line Corporation was formed on ""1 July 1983"" as a State Transport Authority brand, and later became a statutory corporation on ""1 October 2003"". For our calculation, we will use the earlier formation date of 1 July 1983.

Now, we need to calculate the difference between 1 July 1983 and December 2022:
- From 1 July 1983 to 31 December 2022 spans 40 full years plus several months.

Since the specific month isn't critical for the question's context and the year is the main focus, we can conclude it has been approximately 40 years since its formation, with some additional months.

","To find out how many years apart Claire Leroy's gold medal wins at the World Championships were, we need to follow these steps:

1. Identify all the gold medal wins from the given data.
2. Extract the years of those gold medal wins.
3. Calculate the difference between each consecutive gold medal win year.

Step 1: Identifying gold medal wins:
From the provided data, there are three gold medals listed:
- Gold medal - first place | 2007 Saint Quay | Match racing
- Gold medal - first place | 2008 Auckland | Match racing
- Gold medal - first place | 2011 Perth | Match racing

Step 2: Extracting the years:
The years for the gold medals are 2007, 2008, and 2011.

Step 3: Calculating differences:
- Difference between 2007 and 2008: 2008 - 2007 = 1 year
- Difference between 2008 and 2011: 2011 - 2008 = 3 years

Therefore, her gold medal wins were 1 year apart between 2007 and 2008, and then 3 years apart between 2008 and 2011.

Final Answer: The years between Claire Leroy's gold medal wins at the World Championships varied; they were 1 year apart between 2007 and 2008, and 3 years apart between 2008 and 2011."

2. The last T20I was played on 11 June 2022.

Now let's calculate the difference in years:

- From 5 January 1971 to 5 January 2022 is exactly 51 years.
- Since the last T20I was on 11 June 2022, which is after 5 January 2022, we need to add one more year to account for the full year of 2022 up to that date.

Therefore, the total number of years between these two events is 51 + 1 = 52 years.

","To determine how many years are between Australia's first international match and their first AFC U-23 Asian Cup appearance, we need to identify two dates from the information provided:

1. The date of Australia's first international match.
2. The year of Australia's first AFC U-23 Asian Cup appearance.

From the table:
1. The first international match for Australia was against New Caledonia on 6 November 1967.
2. Australia made its first appearance in the AFC U-23 Asian Cup in 2013.

Now, let's calculate the difference between these two dates:

- First AFC U-23 Asian Cup appearance: 2013

The time span between 1967 and 2013 is calculated as follows:

   - The table states that Malaysia's GDP rank was 34th in the nominal category.
   - This information is provided without a specific year, but it's mentioned alongside other 2022 estimates, suggesting it refers to the year 2022.

2. For PPP GDP per capita:
   - The table indicates that Malaysia's PPP GDP per capita was $32,901.
   - This figure is also associated with the year 2022, as seen in the parentheses (2022 est.).

Since both pieces of information are estimated for the same year, 2022, there is no time difference between them.

","To determine how many years before his death Peter III began his reign as King of Sicily, we need to follow these steps:

1. Identify when Peter III's reign as King of Sicily started.
2. Identify when Peter III died.
3. Calculate the difference between these two dates.

Step 1: According to the table, Peter III's reign as King of Sicily began on 4 September 1282.

Step 2: The table states that Peter III died in November 1285.

Step 3: Calculating the difference:
- From September 1282 to August 1285 is 3 full years.
- Adding the part of November 1285 when he died brings us to 3 years and 2 months.

Therefore, Peter III began his reign as King of Sicily approximately 3 years before his death.

","To find out how many years before the ""14 On Fire"" concert tour began the ""50 & Counting"" concert tour ended, we need to follow these steps:

1. Identify the start date of the ""14 On Fire"" tour.
   - From the table, the start date of the ""14 On Fire"" tour is given as 21 February 2014.

2. Identify the end date of the ""50 & Counting"" tour.
   - According to the concert chronology provided, the ""50 & Counting"" tour took place in 2012-13. Since it's common for tours to end towards the latter part of their specified period, we can reasonably assume it ended in late 2013.

3. Calculate the difference in time between the two dates.
   - The ""14 On Fire"" tour started on 21 February 2014.
   - The ""50 & Counting"" tour likely ended sometime around late 2013, but to simplify our calculation, let's consider the end of the year, i.e., 31 December 2013.

4. Determine the number of years between these two points in time.
   - From 31 December 2013 to 21 February 2014 is less than one full year.

Therefore, the ""14 On Fire"" tour began less than one year after the ""50 & Counting"" tour ended.

Final Answer: Less than one year."

","To determine how many years before the 2021 Myanmar protests the general election results occurred, we need to identify the year of the 2020 general election mentioned in the goals of the protests.

The table indicates that one of the goals of the protests is ""Recognition of the 2020 general election results.""

Since the protests began on 2 February 2021, and the general election happened in 2020, we can calculate the difference between these two years.

2021 - 2020 = 1 year

Therefore, the 2020 general election results occurred 1 year before the start of the 2021 Myanmar protests.

","To answer this question, we need to determine two key dates:

1. The drafting date of the 2008 Constitution.
2. The start date of the 2021 Myanmar protests.

From the information provided in the table:

1. The 2008 Constitution is mentioned as one of the goals of the protesters that they wish to abolish.
2. The start date of the 2021 Myanmar protests is given as 2 February 2021.

We know that the 2008 Constitution of Myanmar was drafted in 2007 and ratified in 2008. 

Now, let's calculate the number of years between these two dates:

- Start of protests: 2 February 2021
- Drafting of the 2008 Constitution: 2007

The difference in years between 2021 and 2007 is:
2021 - 2007 = 14 years

Therefore, the 2008 Constitution was drafted 14 years before the start of the 2021 Myanmar protests.

2. Determine if there's any information about when he became Archbishop Emeritus.

Step 1: From the table, we see that his term as Archbishop ended on 17 March 1973.

Step 2: There's no specific date mentioned for when he became Archbishop Emeritus. However, we can infer that he likely took on this honorary title after his active service ended. Given that the term ""Emeritus"" often refers to someone who has retired from their position but retains the title as an honor, we can reasonably assume he became Archbishop Emeritus shortly after 17 March 1973.

Step 3: Since there's no exact date provided for becoming Archbishop Emeritus and no end date given for this honorary title, we cannot calculate the exact number of years he held this title. The information provided does not allow us to definitively state the duration of his service as Archbishop Emeritus.

Final Answer: The information provided does not specify the exact start date or end date of Ambrose Rayappan's service as Archbishop Emeritus of Pondicherry and Cuddalore, so we cannot determine the number of years he served in this capacity."

1. Babe Young's MLB debut was on September 26, 1936, for the New York Giants.
2. His last MLB appearance was on October 2, 1948, for the St. Louis Cardinals.
3. He played for multiple teams during this period, but the specific years of his career are:
   - 1936 (partially)
   - 1939-1942 (full seasons)
   - 1946-1947 (full seasons)
   - 1948 (partially)

Now let's count the total number of years:

- 1936 (partial year)
- 1939, 1940, 1941, 1942 (4 full years)
- 1946, 1947 (2 full years)
- 1948 (partial year)

We count partial years as full years since the question asks about the total number of years he played, not the exact number of full seasons.

Adding these up: 1 + 4 + 2 + 1 = 8 years

Therefore, Babe Young played in MLB for a total of 8 years.

Final Answer: Babe Young played for 8 years in MLB."

","To determine how many years Bayinnaung ruled as the Suzerain of Siam, we need to look at the dates provided for his reign over Siam:

- The start of his reign as Suzerain of Siam was on 18 February 1564.
- The end of his reign was on 10 October 1581, which was the date he died.

Now, let's calculate the duration:

1. From 18 February 1564 to 10 October 1581 spans two full years (1564 and 1565) plus additional partial years from 1566 to 1581.

2. Counting the full years:
   - 1564 to 1580 inclusive = 17 years

3. For the partial years in 1564 and 1581:
   - In 1564, Bayinnaung began ruling on 18 February, so he ruled for the remainder of that year.
   - In 1581, he ruled until his death on 10 October.

4. Adding these partial years to the full years:
   - Partial year in 1564 + 17 full years + partial year in 1581 = 17 years total.

Therefore, Bayinnaung ruled as the Suzerain of Siam for 17 years.

Final Answer: Bayinnaung ruled as the Suzerain of Siam for 17 years."

The period spans parts of two different years (1953 and 1955). We need to count the full years he served plus any partial year at the beginning or end.

- Full years: 1954 (complete)
- Partial years: 
  - From 30 July 1953 to 31 December 1953 (part of 1953)
  - From 1 January 1955 to 12 August 1955 (part of 1955)

Adding these up:
- 1 full year (1954)
- Plus the partial years at the start and end, which together make less than a full year

Thus, Mohammad Yamin served for approximately 1 year and some months as Minister of National Education.

Final Answer: Mohammad Yamin served for about 2 years as Minister of National Education. To be precise, it's slightly less than 2 years but rounding to whole years would not do justice to the actual service time, so the most accurate concise answer based on the given data is 2 years."

","To find out how many years Mohammad-Ali Foroughi served as Prime Minister of Iran, we need to identify all his terms as Prime Minister and calculate the total duration.

From the table, we can see that Mohammad-Ali Foroughi held the position of Prime Minister of Iran three times:

1. From 27 August 1941 to 9 March 1942.
2. From 18 September 1933 to 3 December 1935.
3. From 1 November 1925 to 13 June 1926 (Acting).

Let's calculate the duration for each term:

1. From 27 August 1941 to 9 March 1942:
   - This period spans across two calendar years: 1941 and 1942.
   - In 1941, he served from August 27 to December 31, which is approximately 4 months.
   - In 1942, he served from January 1 to March 9, which is approximately 2 months.
   - Total: about 6 months in 1941 + about 2 months in 1942 = about 8 months.

2. From 18 September 1933 to 3 December 1935:
   - In 1933, he served from September 18 to December 31, which is approximately 3 months.
   - In 1934, he served the entire year, which is 12 months.
   - In 1935, he served from January 1 to December 3, which is approximately 11 months.
   - Total: about 3 months in 1933 + 12 months in 1934 + about 11 months in 1935 = about 26 months.

3. From 1 November 1925 to 13 June 1926 (Acting):
   - In 1925, he served from November 1 to December 31, which is approximately 2 months.
   - In 1926, he served from January 1 to June 13, which is approximately 5 months.

","To determine how many years Nate Archibald played professionally, we need to look at his playing career timeline provided in the ""Career history"" section of the table.

1. The ""Playing career"" entry states that it spanned from 1970 to 1984.
2. We can count the years directly or subtract the end year from the start year and add one because both endpoints are inclusive.
3. Counting the years manually from 1970 to 1984 gives us:
   - 1970, 1971, 1972, 1973, 1974, 1975, 1976, 1977, 1978, 1979, 1980, 1981, 1982, 1983, 1984
   
There are 15 years listed.

Alternatively, calculating it mathematically:
\[ 1984 - 1970 + 1 = 15 \]

Therefore, Nate Archibald played professionally for 15 years.

The table shows:
- Peter III's reign as King of Sicily began on 4 September 1282.
- It ended in November 1285.

Step 1: Calculate the number of complete years he ruled.
From September 1282 to August 1285 is 3 full years.

Step 2: Determine if there was any partial year in November 1285.
Since his reign ended in November 1285, that means part of the year 1285 was also under his rule, adding another year to the total.

Step 3: Add the complete and partial years together.
3 years + 1 year = 4 years

Therefore, Peter III reigned as King of Sicily for 4 years.

Now let's calculate the duration of their marriage:

1. Start year: 1965 (year they got married)
2. End year: 1995 (year they got divorced)

To get the number of years they were married, subtract the start year from the end year:

","To find out how many years it took for inflation in France to decrease by 0.8%, we need to identify the relevant inflation rates provided in the table and calculate the difference between them along with the time span.

From the ""Statistics"" section of the table, we have the following inflation rates:
- Inflation (CPI): 0.5% (2020 est.)
- Inflation (CPI): 1.3% (2019)
- Inflation (CPI): 2.1% (2018)

We can see that the inflation decreased from 2.1% in 2018 to 0.5% in 2020. The total decrease is:
\[ 2.1\% - 0.5\% = 1.6\% \]

Since we're asked about a decrease of 0.8%, let's break down the period between 2018 and 2020 to match this requirement:
- From 2018 to 2019: \( 2.1\% - 1.3\% = 0.8\% \)

So, it took exactly one year (from 2018 to 2019) for inflation to decrease by 0.8%.

","To determine how many years it took for the NYSE to go from a US$20.161 trillion volume to a US$26.2 trillion market cap, we need to identify the years associated with these figures and then calculate the difference between them.

1. The volume figure (US$20.161 trillion) corresponds to the year 2011.
2. The market cap figure (US$26.2 trillion) corresponds to the year 2021.

Now, let's calculate the difference in years between 2011 and 2021:

3. Subtract the earlier year from the later year:
   2021 - 2011 = 10 years

Therefore, it took 10 years for the NYSE to go from a US$20.161 trillion volume to a US$26.2 trillion market cap.

Final Answer: 10 years"

","To find out how long it took for the fourth single to be released after the first single from the album ""14 Shades of Grey,"" we need to follow these steps:

1. Identify the release dates of the first and fourth singles.
2. Calculate the difference between these dates.

Step 1:
- First single: ""Price to Play"" was released on April 1, 2003.
- Fourth single: ""Zoe Jane"" was released on April 5, 2004.

Step 2:
- To calculate the time difference, note that both dates are in consecutive years, making the calculation straightforward.
- From April 1, 2003, to April 1, 2004, is exactly one year.
- From April 1, 2004, to April 5, 2004, is 4 days.

Thus, the total duration is 1 year and 4 days.

However, since the question asks for the number of years, we can consider the full year without counting the additional days, as they do not complete another year.

Final Answer: It took 1 year for the fourth single to be released after the first single."

3. Analyze the recording locations:
   Multiple locations are mentioned where the recording took place, but this doesn't directly impact the duration of the recording process.

4. Calculate the time taken for recording:
   From 2008 to 2009, we can see that the recording started in 2008 and ended before the release date in late 2009.

How many years did the B-24 Skua fly before it was completely retired?,8,aircraft,226,<num_years>,years,head,"category
aircraft

B-24 Skua
Role	Carrier-based dive bomber/fighter | Type of aircraft
Manufacturer	Blackburn Aircraft
First flight	9 February 1937
Introduction	November 1938
Retired	1941 (withdrawn from front line) | March 1945 (withdrawn from other duties)
Primary user	Fleet Air Arm
Number built	192
Variants	Blackburn Roc
['15 Blackburn Skua, Bristol Perseus (15650612347).jpg', 'Blackburn Skua in flight']

","It seems there's a discrepancy in the provided information regarding the B-24 Skua. The name ""B-24 Skua"" is not accurate, as the correct designation should be simply ""Blackburn Skua"". Let's focus on the retirement dates given for the Blackburn Skua.

1. The Blackburn Skua was introduced in November 1938.
2. It was withdrawn from front-line duty in 1941.
3. It was completely retired in March 1945 when it was withdrawn from all remaining duties.

To calculate how long the aircraft flew before complete retirement:
- From its introduction in November 1938 to its last retirement date in March 1945, we need to count the full years plus the partial year.

From November 1938 to November 1945 is 6 full years and 4 additional months (from November 1945 to March 1945).

So, the total time the Blackburn Skua flew before being completely retired is 6 years and 4 months.

However, since the question asks for the number of years, we'll provide the full years only:

","To find out how many years the Coordination Center for Ethnic Germans remained operational, we need to look at its formation and dissolution dates.

1. The table mentions that the Coordination Center was formed around 1937 (""Formed c.1937"").
2. It also states that the center was dissolved on May 8, 1945 (""Dissolved May 8, 1945"").

Now let's calculate the duration:
- From 1937 to 1945 is 8 years.
- However, since it was formed around 1937, we can't count the full year of 1937 as operational time. Therefore, we subtract one year from our total.

So, the Coordination Center for Ethnic Germans remained operational for approximately 7 years.

","To find out how many years the consecration of Valen Chapel took after it was closed, we need to follow these steps:

1. Identify when the chapel was consecrated.
2. Determine the period during which the chapel was closed.
3. Calculate the difference between the consecration date and the end of the closure period.

Step 1: The consecration date is given as 31 July 1949.

Step 2: According to the information provided, the chapel was closed from 1873 to 1949.

Step 3: Now, let's calculate the difference:
- The chapel was closed until 1949.
- It was consecrated on 31 July 1949.
Since the chapel was consecrated right at the end of its closure period, the number of years between the end of closure and consecration is effectively zero, or more precisely, the consecration happened on the last day of the closure period.

Therefore, the consecration did not take place after the chapel was closed, but rather coincided with the reopening of the chapel.

","To determine how long it took to record ""21st Century Breakdown,"" we need to look at the ""Recorded"" information provided in the table.

The table states that the song was recorded between 2008 and 2009.

Step 1: Identify the start year of recording.
The recording began in 2008.

Step 2: Identify the end year of recording.
The recording ended in 2009.

Step 3: Calculate the duration.
Since the recording started in 2008 and ended in 2009, it took two calendar years for the recording process.

However, we should note that the recording didn't necessarily span the entire two years but started in one year and finished in the next. Thus, it's more accurate to say the recording period lasted from late 2008 to early 2009, which is approximately one year of active recording time.

Final Answer: The recording of ""21st Century Breakdown"" took about one year."

","To determine how many years elapsed between Franchitti's first race in the IndyCar Series and his first race in the Champ Car career, we need to identify the dates of these two events from the provided information.

1. First race in the IndyCar Series:
   - From the table, it states that his first race in the IndyCar Series was the 2002 Indianapolis 500.

2. First race in the Champ Car career:
   - According to the table, his first race in the Champ Car career was the 1997 Marlboro Grand Prix of Miami.

Now, let's calculate the difference in years:

- The year of the first IndyCar Series race: 2002
- The year of the first Champ Car race: 1997

Subtracting the earlier year from the later year gives us the number of years elapsed:

2002 - 1997 = 5 years

Therefore, the number of years that elapsed between Franchitti's first race in the IndyCar Series and his first race in the Champ Car career is 5 years.

","To determine how many years elapsed between the reigns of Prince of Serbia for Miloš Obrenović I, we need to focus on his two distinct reign periods listed in the table.

1. First, identify the dates of his reign as Prince of Serbia:
   - Start date: 6 November 1817
   - End date: 25 June 1839

2. Calculate the number of years between these dates:
   - From 6 November 1817 to 25 June 1839, we can break this down into full years plus additional days.
   - He reigned for 21 full years plus the partial year from 6 November 1838 to 25 June 1839.

3. Determine the partial year duration:
   - The partial year starts from late November (1817) and ends in mid-June (1839), which is less than a full year but still part of 1839.
   - Thus, the partial year adds another year to the total.

4. Sum up the total years:
   - Full years: 21
   - Partial year: 1
   - Total years: 21 + 1 = 22

Therefore, the number of years that elapsed during his reign as Prince of Serbia was 22 years.

","To answer this question, we need to determine two key pieces of information:
1. When did Dario Franchitti retire from IndyCar?
2. When was he elected to the Motorsports Hall of Fame?

Step 1: Determine the retirement date from IndyCar.
From the ""IndyCar Series career"" section, we see that his last race was the 2013 Grand Prix of Houston. Therefore, we can infer that he retired from IndyCar after the 2013 season.

Step 2: Find out when he was elected to the Motorsports Hall of Fame.
From the ""Awards"" section, we see that he was elected to the Motorsports Hall of Fame of America in 2019.

Now, we calculate the number of years between his retirement and his induction into the Motorsports Hall of Fame.
Retirement year: 2013
Election year: 2019

Number of years retired before election = Election year - Retirement year
                                         = 2019 - 2013
                                         = 6 years

Final Answer: Dario Franchitti had been retired from IndyCar for 6 years when he was elected to the Motorsports Hall of Fame."

Step 2: The table doesn't specify the exact current year, but based on the instruction, we know the current date is December, 2022. So, we need to calculate the difference between 2022 and 1998:
   2022 - 1998 = 24 years

Therefore, Benedict Cumberbatch has been acting for 24 years.

Final Answer: Benedict Cumberbatch has been acting for 24 years."

","First, we need to identify when the picture of Ronald Reagan and José Napoleón Duarte was taken. According to the table, this picture was taken in 1985.

Next, we need to determine when the Salvadoran Civil War began. The table states that the war started on 15 October 1979.

To find out how many years into the war the picture was taken, we calculate the difference between 1985 and 1979:
1985 - 1979 = 6 years

Therefore, the picture of Ronald Reagan and José Napoleón Duarte was taken 6 years into the war.

","To find out how many years lapsed between the introduction and the frontline withdrawal of the B-24 Skua, we need to identify the relevant dates from the provided information and calculate the difference between them.

1. Introduction date: November 1938.
2. Frontline withdrawal date: 1941.

Now, let's calculate the difference:

- From November 1938 to November 1941 is 3 full years.
- Since it was withdrawn from frontline duties in 1941 and not specifically on a certain month, we can consider it to be before or at the end of the year 1941. For simplicity, we'll assume it was withdrawn right at the end of the year 1941.

Therefore, the period from November 1938 to the end of 1941 covers exactly 3 years.

- The monarch section lists two relevant periods:
  - First period: 1397-1442 for Eric of Pomerania (marked with 'a')
  - Last period: 1513-1523 for Christian II (marked with 'b')

Since we're looking for the last reign, we focus on Christian II's period from 1513 to 1523.

Now, let's calculate the duration:
- Start year: 1513
- End year: 1523

Subtract the start year from the end year:
1523 - 1513 = 10 years

Therefore, the last reign of the Kalmar Union lasted for 10 years.

","To find out how many years longer Hewitt's NBA career lasted compared to his college career, we need to calculate the duration of both careers first.

Step 1: Calculate the duration of Hewitt's college career.
Hewitt played for Mt. SAC from 1964 to 1966, which means he spent 2 years there. Then, he transferred to USC and played from 1966 to 1968, adding another 2 years. Therefore, the total duration of his college career was:
2 years + 2 years = 4 years

Step 2: Calculate the duration of Hewitt's NBA career.
Hewitt's NBA career started in 1968 and ended in 1974. The duration of his NBA career can be calculated as follows:
1974 - 1968 = 6 years

Step 3: Find the difference between the durations of the two careers.
Now, we subtract the duration of his college career from the duration of his NBA career:
6 years (NBA career) - 4 years (college career) = 2 years

1. Identify the orbiter's planned mission duration.
2. Identify the orbiter's elapsed mission duration.

4. Subtract the elapsed duration from the planned duration.

Step 1: The orbiter's planned mission duration is about 7.5 years.

Step 2: The orbiter's elapsed mission duration is given as 2 years, 10 months. We need to convert this into years.

There are 12 months in a year, so:
10 months = 10/12 years = 0.833 years (approximately).

Adding this to the 2 years gives us:
2 + 0.833 = 2.833 years.

Step 3: Both durations are now in years.

Planned duration: 7.5 years
Elapsed duration: 2.833 years

Step 4: Subtract the elapsed duration from the planned duration:
7.5 - 2.833 = 4.667 years

Rounding to one decimal place, the difference is approximately 4.7 years.

Final Answer: 4.7 years"

","To determine how many more years Richard Caswell served as the 1st Governor of North Carolina compared to his term as the 2nd Grand Master of the Masons of North Carolina, we need to calculate the duration of each position he held and then find the difference between these durations.

1. **Term as the 1st Governor of North Carolina**:
   - In office from November 12, 1776, to April 20, 1780.
   - Duration: 3 years, 5 months, and 8 days (from November 12 to April 20).

2. **Term as the 2nd Grand Master of the Masons of North Carolina**:
   - In office from 1788 to 1789.
   - Duration: 1 year.

Now, let's convert these durations into years for easier comparison:

- For the first governorship, approximately 3.4 years (since 5 months and 8 days is slightly less than half a year).
- The second position lasted exactly 1 year.

Subtracting the shorter term from the longer one:

\[ 3.4 \text{ years} - 1 \text{ year} = 2.4 \text{ years} \]

","First, let's determine how long Derrick Brooks played for the Tampa Bay Buccaneers:
- As a player: Tampa Bay Buccaneers (1995-2008)
The duration he played for the Buccaneers is from 1995 to 2008, which is 2008 - 1995 = 13 years.

Next, let's determine how long he was an executive for the Tampa Bay Storm:
- As an executive: Tampa Bay Storm (2011-2017)
The duration he was an executive for the Storm is from 2011 to 2017, which is 2017 - 2011 = 6 years.

Now, we calculate the difference between these two durations:
Duration as player - Duration as executive = 13 years - 6 years = 7 years.

Final Answer: Derrick Brooks was a player for the Tampa Bay Buccaneers for 7 years longer than he was an executive for the Tampa Bay Storm."

","To determine how many years longer Robby Gordon's NASCAR Xfinity Series career was compared to his IndyCar Series career, we need to identify the duration of each career and then subtract the shorter from the longer.

For the NASCAR Xfinity Series career:
- First race: 2001
- Last race: 2011

Duration = Last race year - First race year + 1
         = 2011 - 2001 + 1
         = 11 years

For the IndyCar Series career:
- First race: 1996
- Last race: 2004

Duration = Last race year - First race year + 1
         = 2004 - 1996 + 1
         = 9 years

Now, subtract the duration of the IndyCar Series career from the NASCAR Xfinity Series career:
Difference = Duration of NASCAR Xfinity Series career - Duration of IndyCar Series career
           = 11 - 9
           = 2 years

Therefore, Robby Gordon's NASCAR Xfinity Series career was 2 years longer than his IndyCar Series career.

","First, we need to determine the duration of Leite's playing career and his college career.

From the ""Career information"" section:
- Playing career: 1967-1989, which is 22 years.
- College: Pepperdine (1973-1976), which is 3 years.

Now, we calculate the difference between these two durations:
22 years (playing career) - 3 years (college career) = 19 years

Therefore, Leite's playing career was 19 years longer than his college career.

- **France** was involved from 1977 to 1978 (Operation Lamantin).

Now let's calculate the duration of involvement for each country:
- **Mauritania**: 1979 - 1975 = 4 years
- **France**: 1978 - 1977 = 1 year

Finally, subtract the duration of France's involvement from Mauritania's:

","To find out how many more years Miloš Obrenović's first reign as Prince of Serbia lasted compared to his reign as Grand Vožd of Serbia, we need to calculate the duration of each reign and then subtract the shorter from the longer.

First, let's calculate the duration of his reign as Grand Vožd of Serbia:
- He became Grand Vožd on 23 April 1815.
- He stopped being Grand Vožd on 6 November 1817.
Duration = 6 November 1817 - 23 April 1815 = 2 years, 6 months, and 14 days (approximately 2.5 years).

Next, let's calculate the duration of his reign as Prince of Serbia:
- He became Prince on 6 November 1817.
- He stopped being Prince on 25 June 1839.
Duration = 25 June 1839 - 6 November 1817 = 21 years, 7 months, and 20 days (approximately 21.6 years).

Now, subtract the duration of his reign as Grand Vožd from the duration of his reign as Prince:
21.6 years - 2.5 years = 19.1 years.

Therefore, Miloš Obrenović's first reign as Prince of Serbia was approximately 19.1 years longer than his reign as Grand Vožd of Serbia.

","To determine how many more years Mohammad-Ali Foroughi's second term as the 22nd Prime Minister of Iran lasted compared to his first term, we need to calculate the duration of each term and then subtract the shorter one from the longer one.

First Term:
Start Date: 1 September 1924
End Date: 1 November 1925

Second Term:
Start Date: 27 August 1941
End Date: 9 March 1942

Now let's calculate the durations:

For the First Term:
From 1 September 1924 to 1 November 1925 is approximately 1 year and 2 months.
We can convert this into years for easier calculation: 
1 year + 2/12 = 1 + 1/6 ≈ 1.167 years

For the Second Term:
From 27 August 1941 to 9 March 1942 is approximately 6 months and 12 days.
We can convert this into years:
6 months / 12 + 12 days / 365 ≈ 0.5 + 0.033 ≈ 0.533 years

Now we subtract the duration of the first term from that of the second term:
0.533 years - 1.167 years = -0.634 years

Since the result is negative, it indicates that the second term was actually shorter than the first term. The difference is about 0.634 years, which is roughly 7.6 months.

Therefore, Mohammad-Ali Foroughi's second term was not longer than his first term; instead, it was about 0.634 years shorter.

Final Answer: Mohammad-Ali Foroughi's second term as the 22nd Prime Minister of Iran was approximately 0.634 years shorter than his first term, so it was not longer at all."

Religion	Roman Catholicism

","To find out how many years longer Peter III's reign as King of Aragon and Valencia lasted compared to his reign as King of Sicily, we need to calculate the duration of each reign and then subtract the shorter one from the longer one.

First, let's look at the dates for his reign as King of Aragon and Valencia:
- He began his reign on 27 July 1276.
- He ended his reign in November 1285.

Now, let's look at the dates for his reign as King of Sicily:
- He began his reign on 4 September 1282.
- He ended his reign in November 1285.

Next, we'll calculate the length of each reign:

**Reign as King of Aragon and Valencia:**
From 27 July 1276 to November 1285.
This reign lasted about 9 years and roughly 3 months and 4 days (from July 27th to November).

**Reign as King of Sicily:**
From 4 September 1282 to November 1285.
This reign lasted about 3 years and roughly 2 months and 27 days (from September 4th to November).

Finally, we subtract the duration of his reign as King of Sicily from that as King of Aragon and Valencia:
9 years and 3 months ≈ 9.25 years
3 years and 2 months ≈ 3.17 years
9.25 - 3.17 = 6.08 years

Rounded to the nearest whole number, it's approximately 6 years.

Final Answer: Peter III's reign as King of Aragon and Valencia was about 6 years longer than his reign as King of Sicily."

","To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. Identify the start year of the Hammadid dynasty and the start year of the Zayyanid dynasty.
2. Calculate the duration of the period between the Hammadid and Zayyanid dynasties.
3. Identify the start year of the Rustamid dynasty and the start year of the Zirid dynasty.
4. Calculate the duration of the period between the Rustamid and Zirid dynasties.
5. Subtract the shorter period from the longer period to find how many years longer one period is compared to the other.

Step 1: The Hammadid dynasty started in 1015 and the Zayyanid dynasty started in 1236.

Step 2: Duration between Hammadid and Zayyanid dynasties = 1236 - 1015 = 221 years.

Step 3: The Rustamid dynasty started in 776 and the Zirid dynasty started in 972.

Step 4: Duration between Rustamid and Zirid dynasties = 972 - 776 = 196 years.

Step 5: Difference in duration = 221 years - 196 years = 25 years.

Therefore, the period between the Hammadid and the Zayyanid dynasties was 25 years longer than the period between the Rustamid and the Zirid dynasties.

","To determine how many more years the second renovation took compared to the first one at the Birmingham-Jefferson Convention Complex, we need to follow these steps:

1. Identify the start and end years for each renovation.
2. Calculate the duration of each renovation.
3. Subtract the duration of the first renovation from that of the second renovation.

Step 1: Identifying the years for each renovation:
- First renovation: The table mentions a renovation in 2009, but it does not specify an ending year. Since it's listed separately from the second renovation period, we'll consider it a single-year event in 2009.
- Second renovation: The table lists this as occurring between 2019 and 2021.

Step 2: Calculating the duration of each renovation:
- First renovation: Duration = 1 year (from 2009 to 2009).
- Second renovation: Duration = 2021 - 2019 + 1 = 3 years (from 2019 to 2021 inclusive).

Step 3: Finding the difference in duration between the two renovations:
Difference = Duration of second renovation - Duration of first renovation
           = 3 years - 1 year
           = 2 years

Final Answer: The second renovation lasted 2 years longer than the first renovation."

","To find out how many years longer it took for the transition from the fourth to the fifth edition compared to the first to the second edition, we need to calculate the time difference for each pair of editions and then subtract these differences.

Step 1: Calculate the time difference between the first and second editions.
- First edition: 1995
- Second edition: 1996
Time difference = 1996 - 1995 = 1 year

Step 2: Calculate the time difference between the fourth and fifth editions.
- Fourth edition: 2007
- Fifth edition: 2015
Time difference = 2015 - 2007 = 8 years

Step 3: Subtract the time difference between the first and second editions from the time difference between the fourth and fifth editions.
Difference in time differences = Time difference (fourth to fifth) - Time difference (first to second)
= 8 years - 1 year = 7 years

Final Answer: The time between the fourth and fifth editions was 7 years longer than between the first and second editions."
How many years longer was the time between the withdrawal of the B-24 Skua from the front line and its withdrawal from other duties than the time between its first flight and introduction?,3,aircraft,226,<num_years>,years,head,"category
aircraft

B-24 Skua
Role	Carrier-based dive bomber/fighter | Type of aircraft
Manufacturer	Blackburn Aircraft
First flight	9 February 1937
Introduction	November 1938
Retired	1941 (withdrawn from front line) | March 1945 (withdrawn from other duties)
Primary user	Fleet Air Arm
Number built	192
Variants	Blackburn Roc
['15 Blackburn Skua, Bristol Perseus (15650612347).jpg', 'Blackburn Skua in flight']

","To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. Identify the dates relevant to the withdrawal from the front line and from other duties.
2. Identify the dates relevant to the first flight and introduction.
3. Calculate the difference in years for both sets of dates.
4. Subtract the difference in years between first flight and introduction from the difference in years between withdrawal from front line and from other duties.

Step 1: The B-24 Skua was withdrawn from the front line in 1941 and from other duties in March 1945. The difference between these two dates is:
1945 - 1941 = 4 years

Step 2: The B-24 Skua had its first flight on 9 February 1937 and was introduced in November 1938. To calculate the exact number of years, we can consider that the introduction happened less than a year after the first flight:
1938 - 1937 = 1 year

Step 3 & 4: We subtract the difference in years between the first flight and introduction from the difference in years between the withdrawals:
4 years - 1 year = 3 years

Therefore, the time between the withdrawal of the B-24 Skua from the front line and its withdrawal from other duties was 3 years longer than the time between its first flight and introduction.

","To find out how many years longer Italy was involved compared to Hungary, we need to identify their respective involvement periods first.

From the information given:
- Italy joined the Axis powers in 1940 and remained until 1943 when it switched sides.
- Hungary joined the Axis powers in 1944 and remained until 1945.

Now let's calculate the duration for each:
- Italy: From 1940 to 1943, which is 3 years.
- Hungary: From 1944 to 1945, which is 1 year.

Finally, subtract the shorter period (Hungary) from the longer period (Italy):
- Duration difference = 3 years (Italy) - 1 year (Hungary) = 2 years

Final Answer: Italy was involved for 2 years longer than Hungary."

","To answer this question, we need to determine two things:
1. The year the 2008 Constitution was established.
2. The duration from that year until 2021.

From the information given in the table under the 'Goals' section, one of the goals of the 2021 Myanmar protests is ""Abolition of the 2008 Constitution"". This tells us that the constitution they aim to abolish is the 2008 Constitution.

The 2008 Constitution was established in 2008 according to its name.

Now, let's calculate how many years old the constitution was in 2021:
- The year the constitution was established: 2008
- The year of the protests: 2021

Subtract the earlier year from the later year:
2021 - 2008 = 13 years

Therefore, the 2008 Constitution was 13 years old when the 2021 Myanmar protests aimed to abolish it.

Final Answer: The 2008 Constitution was 13 years old when the 2021 Myanmar protests aimed to abolish it."

","To determine how many years passed between Leo Diegel's first PGA Championship win and his T16 finish at the Masters, we need to identify the relevant dates from the provided information:

1. **First PGA Championship Win**: According to the ""Best results in major championships"" section, Leo Diegel won the PGA Championship in 1928.
2. **T16 Finish at the Masters**: From the same section, it states that he finished T16 at the Masters in 1934.

Now, let's calculate the difference in years:

- Year of first PGA Championship win: 1928
- Year of T16 finish at the Masters: 1934

Subtract the earlier year from the later year:
\[ 1934 - 1928 = 6 \]

Therefore, 6 years passed between Leo Diegel's first PGA Championship win and his T16 finish at the Masters.

","To find out how many years passed between the first flight and the introduction of the JF-17 Thunder, we need to:

1. Identify the date of the first flight.
2. Identify the date of introduction.
3. Calculate the difference between these two dates.

Step 1: The date of the first flight is given as 25 August 2003.

Step 2: The date of introduction is given as 12 March 2007.

Step 3: To calculate the difference:
- From 25 August 2003 to 25 August 2007 is exactly 4 years.
- From 25 August 2007 to 12 March 2007 is 6 months and 17 days.

Since we're looking for a whole number of years, we can approximate that it's less than one full year after 25 August 2007 until 12 March 2007.

Therefore, approximately 3 years and 11 months have passed since 25 August 2007 to 12 March 2007, which we can round up to 4 years when added to the initial 4 years from 2003 to 2007.

However, the exact calculation gives us 3 years and 11 months, which is closer to 4 years but not quite there.

Final Answer: 3 years and 11 months (or approximately 4 years if rounding). For precision, the exact answer is 3 years and 11 months."

","To determine how many years passed between the groundbreaking and the opening of the Carrier Dome, we need to identify these two dates from the information provided in the table.

1. The groundbreaking date is given as November 11, 1978.
2. The opening date is given as September 20, 1980.

Now, let's calculate the difference:

- From November 11, 1978, to November 11, 1980, is exactly 2 years.
- From November 11, 1980, to September 20, 1980, we need to subtract the days:
  - There are 31 days in November, so from November 11 to November 30 is 20 days.
  - Adding December's 31 days, January's 31 days, February's 29 days (it was a leap year), March's 31 days, April's 30 days, May's 31 days, June's 30 days, July's 31 days, August's 31 days, and finally September 1 to September 20, which is 20 days.
  - Total extra days = 20 + 31 + 31 + 29 + 31 + 30 + 31 + 30 + 31 + 20 = 294 days.

Since we're only asked for the number of years and not the exact number of days, we can conclude that the opening happened just under 2 years after the groundbreaking.

However, since the question asks for the number of years passed, and typically such questions look for full years completed, we count it as 2 years.

","To determine how many years passed between when INS Trishul was ordered and when it was laid down, we need to identify the dates for these two events from the table and calculate the difference.

1. **Date of Order**: The table states that INS Trishul was ordered on 17 November 1997.
2. **Date Laid Down**: According to the table, INS Trishul was laid down on 24 September 1999.

Now, let's calculate the difference:

- From 17 November 1997 to 17 November 1999 is exactly 2 years.
- Since 24 September is before 17 November, we subtract one day from the end date (24 September) to align with 17 November for simplicity in calculation.
- Therefore, from 17 November 1997 to 24 September 1999 is just under 2 years.

Since we're looking for the number of full years:
- 17 November 1997 to 17 November 1999 is exactly 2 years.
- Adding the additional period from 17 November 1999 to 24 September 1999 means adding less than a year.

Thus, the total is 2 years minus some days.

","To determine how many years prior to Agustín I's rule the Plan of Iguala took place, we need to follow these steps:

1. Identify the year when the Plan of Iguala was established.
2. Determine when Agustín I began his rule.
3. Calculate the difference between these two dates.

Step 1: The Plan of Iguala took place on 24 February 1821 according to the table.

Step 2: Since Agustín I's abdication happened on 19 March 1823, we can infer that he began his rule shortly after the establishment of the Mexican Empire in 1821. Given the timeline, it's reasonable to conclude that Agustín I started ruling right after the empire was formed, which would be in late 1821 or early 1822.

Step 3: Calculating the difference:
- The Plan of Iguala occurred in 1821.
- Assuming Agustín I began his rule at the start of 1822 (the earliest possible start), there is exactly one year between the two events.

Therefore, the Plan of Iguala took place one year before Agustín I's rule began.

1. The first term was from April 1979 to 28 July 1979.
2. The second term was from 6 March 1990 to April 1992.

Let's calculate the duration of each term:

1. First term:
   - Start date: April 1979
   - End date: 28 July 1979
   - Duration: Approximately 4 months (from April to July)

2. Second term:
   - Start date: 6 March 1990
   - End date: April 1992
   - Duration: From March 1990 to April 1992 is approximately 21 months.

Now, let's sum up the durations:

1. First term: 4 months ≈ 0.33 years
2. Second term: 21 months ≈ 1.75 years

Total duration = 0.33 years + 1.75 years = 2.08 years

Therefore, the total number of years Aslam Watanjar served as Minister of Defense is approximately 2 years.

Career coaching record
College	57-58 (.496)

","To determine how many years Belus Smawley's career was active since 1946, we need to identify his playing career start year and his last year of playing or coaching activity.

From the table:
- The playing career started in 1946.
- The playing career ended in 1952.
- Coaching career started in 1951 and ended in 1956.

Since we're asked about the period starting from 1946, we'll consider both his playing and coaching careers for this calculation.

Step 1: Calculate the duration of his playing career starting from 1946.
- Playing career duration: 1946 - 1952 = 7 years

Step 2: Add the duration of his coaching career starting from when it began in 1951.
- Coaching career duration from 1951 onward: 1951 - 1956 = 6 years, but since we already counted part of 1951 under playing career, we only add 5 additional years for coaching (from 1952 to 1956).

Step 3: Sum up the total years.
- Total active years = 7 years (playing) + 5 years (coaching) = 12 years

However, since the question asks specifically about the years since 1946 and considering he transitioned into coaching mid-way through 1951 while still playing until the end of that season, we should not double-count the overlapping year (1951).

1 January 1917	Closed
7 July 1919	Re-opened
1 February 1925	Renamed | Cheltenham Spa Malvern Road
3 January 1966	Closed

","To determine how many years Cheltenham Spa station was open before its first closure, we need to identify two key dates:

1. The opening date of the station.
2. The first closing date of the station.

From the table:
- The station opened on 30 March 1908 under the name ""Cheltenham Malvern Road"".
- It closed for the first time on 1 January 1917.

Now, let's calculate the duration between these two dates:

- From 30 March 1908 to 31 December 1908: 9 months and 1 day.
- From 1 January 1917 back to 31 December 1916: 1 year.

Adding up these periods:
- Total years = 8 years (complete years from 1908 to 1916) + 9 months and 1 day.

Since the question asks for the number of years, we can say that the station was open for almost 9 years before it closed for the first time.

Final Answer: 8 years and 9 months (or approximately 9 years)."

","To determine how many years Cheltenham Spa station was operational after its reopening in 1919, we need to follow these steps:

1. Identify the reopening date: According to the table, the station reopened on 7 July 1919.
2. Find the next closure date after the reopening: From the table, the next closure date is 3 January 1966.
3. Calculate the duration between the reopening and the subsequent closure:
   - Start year: 1919
   - End year: 1966
   - Duration: 1966 - 1919 = 47 years

However, since the station reopened mid-year and closed mid-year, we should not count the partial years at the beginning and end. In this case, since both reopening and closing dates are specific days within their respective years, we can consider the full years between them.

Therefore, the station was operational for 47 years after it reopened in 1919.

","To determine how many years Mohammad-Ali Foroughi was a member of the Parliament of Iran, we need to look at the dates provided for his term in that role:

- Member of the Parliament of Iran:
  In office: 19 November 1909 - 3 August 1921

We can calculate the duration by subtracting the start year from the end year and adjusting for the months if necessary:

1. The start date is 19 November 1909.
2. The end date is 3 August 1921.

First, let's calculate the difference in years:

1921 - 1909 = 12 years

Now, we need to account for the partial years at the beginning and the end:

- He started on 19 November 1909, which is more than half a year into 1909, so we count 1909 as a full year.
- He ended on 3 August 1921, which is less than half a year into 1921, so we do not count 1921 as a full year.

Therefore, he served the equivalent of almost 12 full years.

Final Answer: Mohammad-Ali Foroughi was a member of the Parliament of Iran for approximately 12 years."

","To determine how many years Steve Jobs was active in his career, we need to look at the ""Years active"" information provided in the table.

The table states that Steve Jobs' years active were from 1976 to 2011.

Now, let's calculate the duration:
- Start year: 1976
- End year: 2011

We can find the number of years he was active by subtracting the start year from the end year and adding one (since both the start and end years are inclusive).

Calculation:
\[ 2011 - 1976 + 1 = 36 \]

Therefore, Steve Jobs was active in his career for 36 years.

['15 Blackburn Skua, Bristol Perseus (15650612347).jpg', 'Blackburn Skua in flight']

","The question asks for how many years the B-24 Skuas were on the front line. However, there's a discrepancy here because the table refers to an aircraft named ""B-24 Skua,"" which seems to be incorrect or a mislabel. The correct name of the aircraft according to the table is ""Blackburn Skua.""

Let's clarify and proceed based on the information provided about the Blackburn Skua:
1. The Blackburn Skua was introduced in November 1938.
2. It was withdrawn from front-line duty in 1941.

To calculate the number of years it served on the front line, we need to count the full years between its introduction and retirement from front-line duty:

From November 1938 to the end of that year, it served part of 1938.
From 1939 to 1940 inclusive, it served two full years.
In 1941, it was retired at some point during the year, so it did not serve a full year.

Adding these up:
1938 (partial year) + 2 full years (1939 and 1940) = 2 full years plus a partial year of service.

However, since the question specifically asks for the number of full years, the answer would be 2 years.

From the table, we see the following information under ""Spouse(s)"" for Joan Crawford:
- For Alfred Steele: ""(married 1955; died 1959)""

This tells us that Joan Crawford married Alfred Steele in 1955. The entry also states that Alfred Steele died in 1959. 

Since marriages end either through divorce or death, and given that the entry specifies that Alfred Steele died in 1959, we can conclude that their marriage lasted from 1955 until 1959.

Now, let's calculate the duration of their marriage:
- Start year: 1955

Place	Esztergom, Hungary, Austria-Hungary

Episcopal consecration
Principal consecrator	Diomede Falconio
Co-consecrators	Giacomo Ghezzi | Graziano Génnaro
Date	18 June 1892
Place	Rome, Italy

","To find out how many years were between Mišić's ordination and consecration, we need to look at the dates for both events and calculate the difference.

From the information provided:
- Ordination date: 7 July 1882
- Consecration date: 18 June 1912

Now, let's calculate the difference between these two dates:

1. From 7 July 1882 to 7 July 1912 is exactly 30 years.
2. From 7 July 1912 to 18 June 1912 is about one month before the next year's anniversary.

Since we're looking for the number of years, we can consider that Mišić was consecrated just a little more than 30 years after his ordination. Therefore, the difference is approximately 30 years.

Junior World Championships
['Gold medal - first place | 1980 Örnsköldsvik | 4 × 5 km relay']

","To determine how many years were between Pettersen's first gold medal and her last, we need to identify the years of her first and last gold medals from the provided information.

From the ""World Championships"" section:
- First gold medal: 1982 Oslo (4 × 5 km relay)
- Last gold medal: Also 1982 Oslo (4 × 5 km relay)

From the ""Olympic Games"" section:
- Gold medal: 1984 Sarajevo (4 × 5 km relay)

The earliest gold medal year is 1982, and the latest gold medal year is also 1982 for the world championships, and 1984 for the Olympics. However, since we're looking for the difference between the first and last gold medals within the same category (world championships or olympics), we should consider the two distinct categories separately but take the overall span if they differ.

For World Championships, the span is from 1982 to 1982, which is 0 years.
For Olympic Games, the span is from 1984 to 1984, which is also 0 years.

Since the World Championships have a wider range (including 1982), we use that.

Therefore, the number of years between her first and last gold medal is 1982 to 1982, which is 0 years.

","First, we need to identify the relevant events from the table for both the Los Angeles Olympics and the Edmonton Pan Am Games.

From the Olympic Games section:
- Gold medals at the 1984 Los Angeles Olympics: 
  - 4×100 m freestyle
  - 4×100 m medley

From the Pan Pacific Games section, we can see Edmonton was not mentioned, so we should look into the next section which is the Summer Universiade. But the question specifically asks about Edmonton Pan Am Games, so we need to look further. It's actually listed under the next section:

From the Pan American Games section:
- Gold medal at the 1995 Mar del Plata games (not Edmonton), but Edmonton is mentioned in the Summer Universiade section.
- However, the question seems to be mixing up the names of competitions. The Edmonton event is in the Summer Universiade section, not the Pan American Games section. So let's focus on the Edmonton event in the correct section:
  
From the Summer Universiade section:
- Silver medal at the 1983 Edmonton Summer Universiade.

Since the question asks about gold medals at Edmonton Pan Am Games, and no such entry exists, it appears there might be a confusion or typo in the question. But if we consider the closest match which is Edmonton Summer Universiade, we calculate the difference between 1984 and 1983:

1984 - 1983 = 1 year

However, since the question specifies gold medals at Edmonton Pan Am Games which doesn't exist in the data provided, the question cannot be accurately answered based on the given information.

Final Answer: The question contains a mix-up between different types of competitions and medals, leading to an unclear query. Based on the provided data, there is no gold medal record for Edmonton Pan Am Games. The closest match would be Edmonton Summer Universiade, but that does not have a gold medal. Thus, we cannot provide a precise number of years between the specified events."

","To find out how many years there were between Michael Owen joining Real Madrid and leaving Manchester United, we need to identify the relevant dates from his senior career timeline:

1. Owen joined Real Madrid in 2004.
2. Owen left Manchester United in 2012 (since his time at Manchester United is listed as 2009-2012).

Now, let's calculate the difference:

Step 2: Identifying the year when Denmark-Norway was established:
According to the table, Denmark-Norway was established in 1537.

Step 3: Calculating the difference:
The difference between 1537 (when Denmark-Norway was established) and 1523 (the end of Christian II's reign) is 1537 - 1523 = 14 years.

","To find out how much longer Abdul Jeelani's NBA career was compared to his college career, we need to identify the duration of each period first.

From the table:
- His college career at Wisconsin-Parkside was from 1972 to 1976.
- His NBA career (based on the listed teams) started in 1976 and ended in 1989.

Step 1: Calculate the length of the college career.
Jeelani attended college from 1972 to 1976.
Length of college career = End year - Start year = 1976 - 1972 = 4 years

Step 2: Calculate the length of the NBA career.
Jeelani played professionally (which includes his NBA stint) from 1976 to 1989.
However, since the specific NBA career details are not directly given, we'll consider the NBA stint based on the draft year and the first team he joined after the draft.
The NBA stint appears to be from 1976 to 1979 when he played for Lazio (likely referring to the Portland Trail Blazers in the NBA).
Length of NBA career = End year - Start year = 1979 - 1976 = 3 years

Step 3: Compare the durations.
Difference in years = Length of NBA career - Length of college career = 3 years - 4 years = -1 year

Since the result is negative, it means his NBA career was shorter than his college career by 1 year.

Final Answer: Jeelani's NBA career was not longer than his college career; instead, it was 1 year shorter."

","First, let's identify the key information from the table that we need to answer the question:
1. Adolf von Baeyer's birth date: 31 October 1835
2. The year he received the Nobel Prize for Chemistry: 1905

To calculate how old he was when he won the Nobel Prize for Chemistry, we subtract his birth year from the year he won the prize:
1905 - 1835 = 70 years

However, we must also consider the month and day to determine if he had already celebrated his birthday in that year:
Since his birthday is on 31 October and he won the Nobel Prize in 1905, he would have already turned 70 by the time he won the prize.

Therefore, Adolf von Baeyer was 70 years old when he won the Nobel Prize for Chemistry.

Let's break down the calculation:

- Years: 1912 - 1859 = 53 years
- Since his birthday hadn't occurred yet in 1912 (29 April comes before 10 November), he had not turned 53.

Therefore, he was 52 years and a few months old when he was appointed.

","To determine how old Stéphane Antiga was when he first played for Paris Volley, we need to follow these steps:

1. Identify the year Stéphane Antiga started playing for Paris Volley.
2. Calculate his age based on his birth year and the year he joined Paris Volley.

Step 1: From the ""Career"" section of the table:
- The entry for Paris Volley shows the years 1998-2003.

Step 2: We know from the ""Personal information"" section that Stéphane Antiga was born on February 3, 1976. Therefore, if he started playing for Paris Volley in 1998:
- Age = Year of joining Paris Volley - Birth year
- Age = 1998 - 1976 = 22

However, since his birthday is on February 3, we need to consider whether he had already had his birthday in 1998 before starting with Paris Volley. As there's no specific month given for when he joined Paris Volley, and typically players join teams at the start of a season (often in September), we can reasonably assume he would have already turned 22 by then.

Therefore, Stéphane Antiga was likely 22 years old when he first played for Paris Volley.

Final Answer: Stéphane Antiga was 22 years old when he first played for Paris Volley."

1. Identify the earliest gold medal win from the list provided.
2. Determine the date of that event.
3. Calculate her age based on her birth date and the event date.

Step 1: From the list provided under Island Games, the earliest gold medal win mentioned is in 2011 at the Isle of Wight for both 200m backstroke and 400m medley.

Step 2: The exact date within 2011 isn't specified, but it's safe to assume the event took place sometime during the year 2011.

Step 3: Charlotte Atkinson's birth date is given as November 29, 1996. To calculate her age at the time of her first gold medal, we can simply subtract her birth year from the year of her first medal win:
2011 - 1996 = 15 years old

However, since her birthday is in November, and the Island Games usually take place earlier in the year, she would have turned 15 during that year. Therefore, she was still 14 when she won her first gold medal.

","First, we need to determine Claire Leroy's age in 2007. According to the table, Claire Leroy was born on 9 March 1980. The 2007 World Championships took place in Saint Quay.

To find out how old Claire Leroy was in 2007, we subtract her birth year from the year of the event:
2007 - 1980 = 27 years

However, since her birthday is on March 9th, we need to consider whether her birthday had occurred yet in 2007. Since the World Championships took place in Saint Quay (which is likely in the first half of the year), we can assume that her birthday had already happened, meaning she would have turned 27 that year.

Therefore, Claire Leroy was 27 years old when she won gold at the 2007 World Championships.

1. **Identify the birth year:** From the table, Dawn McEwen's birth date is given as July 3, 1980.
   
2. **Determine the year of the event:** The 2014 Sochi Olympics took place in 2014.

3. **Calculate her age in 2014:** 
   - Subtract her birth year from the year of the event:
     \[
     2014 - 1980 = 34
     \]

4. **Consider her birthday relative to the event date:** Since the Olympics occur during winter, it's reasonable to assume that the event would have taken place before her birthday in July. Thus, she had not yet turned 35 by the time the Olympics occurred.

Therefore, Dawn McEwen was 34 years old when she won the gold at the 2014 Sochi Olympics.

Final Answer: Dawn McEwen was 34 years old when she won the gold at the 2014 Sochi Olympics."

","To find out how old Dennis Erickson was when he won the Big Sky Championship in 1985, we need to follow these steps:

1. Identify Dennis Erickson's birth year from the personal information.
2. Calculate his age in 1985.

Step 1: From the ""Personal information"" section, we see that Dennis Erickson was born on March 24, 1947.

Step 2: To calculate his age in 1985:
- In 1985, Dennis would have turned 38 years old because 1985 minus 1947 equals 38.
- Since his birthday is on March 24th, and the championship win would be after this date, we can confirm he was indeed 38 years old during the 1985 season when he won the Big Sky Championship.

Final Answer: Dennis Erickson was 38 years old when he won the Big Sky Championship in 1985."

2. Identify the year Derrick Brooks was drafted.
3. Calculate his age at the time of the draft.

Step 1: From the personal information section, we see that Derrick Brooks was born on April 18, 1973.

Step 2: The career information section states that Derrick Brooks was drafted in 1995.

Step 3: To calculate his age in 1995, we subtract his birth year from the draft year:

However, since his birthday is in April and the NFL Draft typically happens in April, we need to confirm if the draft occurred before or after his birthday. Given that the draft happened in 1995 and his birthday is also in April 1995, he would have just turned 22 during the draft year.

Therefore, Derrick Brooks was 22 years old when he was drafted.

- However, since the award is for the entire season, and typically such awards are decided around the end of the season or shortly after, we can assume it's reasonable to consider him 29 years old for the award-winning year if the announcement was made late in the year or afterwards.

Therefore, Derrick Brooks was 29 years old when he won the NFL Defensive Player of the Year award in 2002.

Step 1: From the ""Personal information"" section, we see that Derrick Summers was born on June 19, 1988.

Step 2: In the ""Career history"" section, it's mentioned that he played for the Jacksonville Sharks from 2011 to 2013.

Step 3: To calculate his age when he started playing for the Jacksonville Sharks in 2011:
- Since his birthday is on June 19, if the season started before or on that day, he would be turning 23 in 2011. Otherwise, he would have already turned 23 before the start of the season.
- Given that the typical start of a sports season is around spring or summer, it's reasonable to assume that if the season started before June 19, he would still be 22 until his birthday.

Since the exact start date of the season isn't specified and without more context, we can reasonably conclude that he was likely 23 years old at the beginning of the season, but if the season began right after his birthday, he could have been considered 22 during part of the season.

However, since he had just turned 23, we'll use 23 as his age for simplicity.

Final Answer: Derrick Summers was 23 years old when he played for the Jacksonville Sharks in 2011."

- Subtract her birth year from the year of the Olympic appearance: 2018 - 1989 = 29 years.
- Since her birthday is on February 14, and the Olympics typically occur in winter (February or March), we can assume that if her birthday had not yet occurred in 2018, she would still be 28. However, for simplicity and since the exact date isn't specified, we'll consider she turned 29 during the same year of the event.

Therefore, Emma Miskew was 29 years old when she appeared in the 2018 Olympic Games.

Final Answer: Emma Miskew was 29 years old when she appeared in the 2018 Olympic Games."

","To determine how old Emmitt Smith was when he received the NFL Most Valuable Player Award in 1993, we need to follow these steps:

1. Find Emmitt Smith's birth year from the personal information section.
2. Calculate his age in 1993 based on that birth year.

Step 1: From the personal information section, we see that Emmitt Smith was born on May 15, 1969.

Step 2: To calculate his age in 1993:
- In 1993, if it's before May 15, he would be 23 years old.
- If it's after or on May 15, he would be 24 years old.

Since the award was given in 1993, and we don't have a specific date for the award ceremony, we can assume it was given sometime during the season which would typically be after the player has played a significant portion of the year. Therefore, it is reasonable to conclude that the award was given when he was already 24 years old.

1. Identify the birth year of Heiko Kroeger.
2. Determine the year Heiko Kroeger won the gold medal at the Paralympics (not the Olympics).
3. Calculate his age during that event.

Step 1: Birth Year
From the ""Personal Information"" section, we see that Heiko Kroeger was born on March 27, 1966.

Step 2: Year of Gold Medal Win at Paralympics
In the ""Paralympic Games"" section, it shows that Heiko Kroeger won a gold medal at the 2000 Sydney Paralympics.

Step 3: Calculate Age
Since he won the gold medal at the 2000 Paralympics, we calculate his age:
2000 - 1966 = 34 years old
However, since his birthday is March 27th, and the Paralympics were held later in the year, he would have turned 34 during the event.

The question asks about the Olympics, but based on the provided data, there's only information about the Paralympics. Assuming the intent was to ask about the Paralympics instead:

Final Answer: Heiko Kroeger was 34 years old when he won a gold medal at the 2000 Paralympics."

","To determine how old Jeffrey Epstein was when he was apprehended in 2019, we need to follow these steps:

1. Identify his birth year from the information given.
2. Determine the specific year he was apprehended.
3. Calculate his age at the time of his apprehension.

Step 1: From the table, Jeffrey Epstein's birth year is listed as 1953.

Step 2: The table states that he was apprehended on July 6, 2019.

Step 3: To calculate his age:
- We subtract his birth year from the year of apprehension: 2019 - 1953 = 66 years.
- Since his birthday (January 20) had already passed in 2019 before his apprehension on July 6, we don't need to adjust this number.

Therefore, Jeffrey Epstein was 66 years old when he was apprehended in 2019.

","First, we need to find out when Jeffrey Epstein was born and when he was convicted in 2008.

From the table:
- Born: January 20, 1953
- Penalty/Criminal charge: Procuring an underage girl for prostitution; sex trafficking
- Penalty: 13 months with work release (2008)

Now, let's calculate his age at the time of conviction in 2008.

To calculate his age in 2008, subtract his birth year from the year of conviction:
2008 - 1953 = 55 years

Since his birthday is on January 20th, and the penalty is given for that year, we can confirm that he had already had his birthday that year before being convicted.

Final Answer: Jeffrey Epstein was 55 years old when he was convicted in 2008."

2. Determine the year of the last gold medal win.
3. Calculate her age during that year.

Step 1: From the table, we can see that Kaija Parve was born on 14 June 1964.

Step 2: The table shows that her last gold medal win was at the 1988 Chamonix World Championships.

Step 3: To calculate her age, we subtract her birth year from the year of the event:
1988 - 1964 = 24

However, we must consider whether she had already celebrated her birthday in 1988 or not. Since her birthday is on June 14th, and the championships took place in 1988, it's possible she hadn't yet celebrated her 24th birthday. Given that the exact date of the event isn't specified but typically such events happen around the same time each year (likely not before mid-year), it's reasonable to conclude she would have turned 24 during this event if it happened post-June 14th. Without more specific information, we'll assume she was turning 24 that year.

Final Answer: Kaija Parve was 24 years old when she won her last gold medal at the 1988 Chamonix World Championships."

","To determine how old Murilo Bustamante was when he began his MMA career, we need to follow these steps:

1. Identify Murilo Bustamante's birth year from the table.
2. Determine the year he started his MMA career based on the ""Years active"" information provided.
3. Calculate the age difference between these two years.

Step 1: From the table, we can see that Murilo Bustamante was born on July 30, 1966.

Step 2: The table indicates that his MMA career was active from 1991 to 2012. Therefore, he started his MMA career in 1991.

Step 3: To find out how old he was in 1991, we subtract his birth year from 1991:
1991 - 1966 = 25

However, since his birthday is on July 30, and we're calculating for the start of his career which is presumably at some point in 1991 (and not necessarily after his birthday), if his career started before July 30, 1991, he would still be considered 24. But typically, in such cases, the common practice is to consider the full year unless specified otherwise.

","To determine how old Nicki Minaj was when she ended her partnership with Safaree Samuels, we need to follow these steps:

1. Identify Nicki Minaj's birth year from the table.
2. Determine the end year of her partnership with Safaree Samuels.
3. Calculate her age at that time.

Step 1: From the table, we can see that Nicki Minaj was born on December 8, 1982.

Step 2: The table shows that Nicki Minaj's relationship with Safaree Samuels lasted from 2000 to 2014. Therefore, their partnership ended in 2014.

Step 3: To calculate her age in 2014, we subtract her birth year from the year her partnership ended:
2014 - 1982 = 32 years old

However, since her birthday is on December 8, and the partnership ended in 2014, she would have turned 32 after the partnership had already ended. So, when the partnership ended, she was 31 years old.

Final Answer: Nicki Minaj was 31 years old when she ended her partnership with Safaree Samuels."

","To determine how old Peter III was when he became King of Aragon and Valencia, we need to find two key pieces of information: his birth year and the year he began his reign.

1. From the table, we can see that Peter III was born circa 1239.
2. His reign as King of Aragon and Valencia started on 27 July 1276.

Now, let's calculate his age when he became king:
- If Peter III was born around 1239 and became king in 1276, we subtract his birth year from the start of his reign: 1276 - 1239 = 37 years.

However, since he was born 'circa' 1239, it means he was born sometime around that year but not necessarily exactly at the beginning of the year. So, he would have turned 37 during 1276 if he was born anytime between January 1st, 1239, and December 31st, 1239. Since we don't know the exact month or day of his birth, we can conclude that he was either turning 37 or had just turned 37 when he became king.

Therefore, Peter III was approximately 37 years old when he became King of Aragon and Valencia.

Final Answer: Peter III was approximately 37 years old when he became King of Aragon and Valencia."

Step 1: Identifying Peter III's Birth Year
The table states that Peter III was born circa 1239.

Step 2: Identifying the Start Year of His Reign
According to the table, Peter III's reign as King of Aragon and Valencia began on 27 July 1276.

Step 3: Calculating Age at the Start of His Reign
Subtracting his birth year from the start year of his reign:
1276 - 1239 = 37 years

Since his reign started in July and he was born circa (around) the end of the year 1239, he would have turned 37 during the first part of his reign.

Final Answer: Peter III was approximately 37 years old when he started his reign as King of Aragon and Valencia."

","To determine how old Roger Federer was when he won his first Olympic gold medal, we need to follow these steps:

1. Identify when Federer won his first Olympic gold medal.
2. Find out Federer's birth year.
3. Calculate his age during the year of his first Olympic gold medal.

Step 1: From the table, under ""Other doubles tournaments,"" it states that Federer won a Gold medal in 2008.

Step 2: The table mentions that Federer was born on 8 August 1981.

Step 3: To calculate Federer's age in 2008:
   2008 - 1981 = 27 years old.

However, since his birthday is on August 8th, we must consider if the Olympics happened before or after his birthday that year. The Olympics in 2008 were held from August 8 to August 24. Therefore, Federer turned 27 during the same month the Olympics took place.

Thus, Federer was 26 years old when he won his first Olympic gold medal because his 27th birthday occurred during the same month of the event.

Final Answer: Roger Federer was 26 years old when he won his first Olympic gold medal."

","To determine how old Ryan Hunter-Reay was when he won the IndyCar Rookie of the Year award, we need to follow these steps:

1. Find the year Ryan Hunter-Reay won the IndyCar Rookie of the Year award.
2. Determine Ryan Hunter-Reay's birth year from his birthday information.
3. Calculate his age during the year he won the Rookie of the Year award.

Step 1: From the ""Awards"" section, we see that Ryan Hunter-Reay won the ""Indianapolis 500 Rookie of the Year"" in 2008.

Step 2: The ""Born"" field states that Ryan Hunter-Reay was born on December 17, 1980.

Step 3: To calculate his age in 2008:
- Since his birthday is on December 17, 1980, he would have turned 28 years old on December 17, 2008.
- However, since the Rookie of the Year award is typically awarded at the end of the season, it's safe to assume he was still 27 for most of the year until his birthday.

","To determine how old Ryan Hunter-Reay was when he won the Skip Barber National Championship in 1999, we need to follow these steps:

1. Identify the year Ryan won the Skip Barber National Championship:
   - From the ""Championship titles"" section, we see that he won the Skip Barber National Championship in 1999.

2. Find Ryan's birth year:
   - From the ""Born"" section, we know that Ryan Hunter-Reay was born on December 17, 1980.

- Since his debut was in September 1989 and his birthday is in December 1964, he would have turned 24 years old in December 1989.
- Therefore, when he debuted in September 1989, he was 24 years old minus the fraction of the year not yet completed since his last birthday, which means he was 24 years old, but technically just shy of his 25th birthday.

Final Answer: Steve Austin was 24 years old when he began his professional wrestling career."

","To determine how old Steve Austin was when he originally retired from professional wrestling, we need to follow these steps:

1. Identify the year Steve Austin originally retired.
2. Find out when Steve Austin was born.
3. Calculate his age at retirement.

Step 1: From the table, under ""Professional wrestling career"", it states that Steve Austin's original retirement date was March 30, 2003.

Step 2: The table also provides Steve Austin's birth information. It states he was born on December 18, 1964.

Step 3: To calculate his age at retirement, subtract his birth year from his retirement year:
   - Retirement year: 2003
   - Birth year: 1964
   - Age = 2003 - 1964 = 39 years old

However, since his birthday is in December and he retired in March, he had not yet celebrated his 39th birthday at the time of retirement. Therefore, he was 38 years old when he originally retired.

Final Answer: Steve Austin was 38 years old when he originally retired from professional wrestling."

","First, we need to identify which medal was won in Argentina. However, reviewing the medals listed, there is no mention of a medal won in Argentina. The medals mentioned are:

- Gold medal - first place in 2014 Poland (FIVB World Championship)
- Bronze medal - third place in 2017 Curitiba (FIVB World League)
- Silver medal - second place in 2003 Germany (CEV European Championship)
- Silver medal - second place in 2009 Turkey (CEV European Championship)
- Bronze medal - third place in 2015 Japan (FIVB World Cup)

Since none of these matches a medal won in Argentina, it seems there may be a mistake or missing information in the question. Given this, we can't accurately determine Stéphane Antiga's age when winning a medal in Argentina based on the provided data.

However, if we assume the question meant to ask about one of the mentioned medals, let's consider the closest match in terms of geographical proximity to Argentina among the given options, which would be the bronze medal from the 2015 FIVB World Cup in Japan.

Let's calculate his age for the 2015 FIVB World Cup:
- Stéphane Antiga was born on February 3, 1976.
- In 2015, he would have turned 39 years old since he had already celebrated his birthday that year.

Final Answer: Based on the available data and assuming the question refers to the FIVB World Cup in Japan in 2015, Stéphane Antiga was 39 years old when he won the bronze medal. However, the original question's reference to Argentina does not align with any provided medal information."

- If his birthday had not occurred yet in 2011, he would have been 24 years old (since he turned 24 during 2011).
- Since his birthday (July 26) is in the first half of the year, and the Pan American Games were held in 2011 (specifically in Guadalajara), we can safely say that he had already turned 25 by the time of the games.

Therefore, Thiago Alves was 25 years old when he won the gold medal in the Pan American Games in 2011.

Final Answer: Thiago Alves was 25 years old when he won gold in the Pan American Games in 2011."

Step 1: From the table, we see that Tony Stewart was born on May 20, 1971.

Step 2: According to the table, Tony Stewart's first win in the NASCAR Cup Series was the 1999 Exide NASCAR Select Batteries 400 (Richmond). However, the question specifically asks about his first win in 2002. Looking at the achievements section, we can find that he won the 2002 Chili Bowl, which is part of NASCAR but not the Cup Series.

","To determine how old Babe Young was when he made his MLB debut, we need to follow these steps:

1. Identify the birth year of Babe Young.
2. Identify the year of his MLB debut.
3. Subtract the birth year from the debut year.

Step 1: From the table, we see that Babe Young was born on July 1, 1915.

Step 2: The table states that his MLB debut was on September 26, 1936.

Step 3: To calculate his age at the time of his debut, we subtract the birth year from the debut year:
1936 - 1915 = 21 years.

However, since his birthday is in July and his debut was in September, he would have already had his birthday that year. Therefore, he was 21 years old when he made his MLB debut.

Final Answer: Babe Young was 21 years old when he made his MLB debut."

","To determine how old the church was when it initially closed, we need to find two key pieces of information from the table: the founding date and the initial closing date.

1. The founding date of the church is given as the 13th century.
2. The initial closing date is provided as 1873.

Since the founding date is given in centuries rather than specific years, we can use the approximate midpoint of the 13th century for our calculation. The 13th century spans from 1201 to 1300 AD. A reasonable approximation for the midpoint would be around 1250 AD.

Now, let's calculate the age of the church at the time it closed in 1873:
- Subtract the founding year from the closing year: 1873 - 1250 = 623 years.

Therefore, the church was approximately 623 years old when it initially closed.

Final Answer: The church was approximately 623 years old when it initially closed."

2. Identify the year the church was consecrated.
3. Calculate the difference between the founding year and the consecration year.

Step 1: The table states that the church was founded in the 13th century. To get a specific year, we'll use the common midpoint for centuries, which is usually around 50 years after the start of the century. So, we'll use 1250 AD as our founding year.

Step 2: The consecration date is given as 31 July 1949.

Step 3: Subtract the founding year from the consecration year:
1949 - 1250 = 699 years

","To determine how old Percy Faith would have been if he had died three months later in 1976, we need to follow these steps:

1. Identify Percy Faith's birth year: According to the table, Percy Faith was born in 1908.
2. Determine his actual age at death: He died on February 9, 1976, aged 67 years.
3. Calculate the exact birthdate: Since he was 67 when he died on February 9, 1976, he must have been born on April 7, 1908 (since he hadn't reached his birthday yet).
4. Figure out the new death date: Three months after February 9, 1976, would be May 9, 1976.
5. Calculate the new age: From April 7, 1908, to May 9, 1976, would make him 68 years old.

","To determine how many years a judge can serve before needing a five-year extension, we need to focus on the term limits provided in the information:

1. Judges can serve until they reach 75 years of age.
2. If they are still serving when they turn 75, they can be extended for five more years, which can be renewed indefinitely.

Given these points, if a judge is appointed at the age of 50:
- They have 25 years of service ahead of them (75 - 50 = 25).
- After reaching 75, they can start seeking five-year extensions.

Therefore, no five-year extension is required within those initial 25 years.

Final Answer: A judge appointed at the age of 50 can serve for 25 years before a five-year extension is required."

[' Republic of China (1924-1948)']

","To find the year when China first participated in the Winter Olympics but not in the Summer Olympics, we need to compare the years China appeared in both events:

Step 1: Identify the years China appeared in the Winter Olympics.
The Winter appearances list shows that China started participating in 1980.

Step 2: Identify the years China appeared in the Summer Olympics.
The Summer appearances list indicates that China has participated since 1952, with some gaps from 1956 to 1980.

Step 3: Determine if there is any year where China only appeared in the Winter Olympics.
From Step 1 and Step 2, we see that 1980 is the first year China appears in the Winter Olympics list. We also observe from the Summer appearances list that China did not participate in the Summer Olympics between 1956 and 1980.

Step 4: Confirm if 1980 is the correct answer.
Since China did not appear in the Summer Olympics in 1980 (the gap continued until 1984), and it was the first year China appeared in the Winter Olympics, 1980 is indeed the year we are looking for.

1. Italian Eritrea was established in 1890.
2. The monarchy of the Ethiopian Empire was abolished on 21 March 1975.

Now, let's calculate the difference:

From 1890 to 1975 is 85 years.

However, since we're looking at the period up until the end of March 1975, we should consider that the full year of 1975 has not yet elapsed by December 2022. But typically, when calculating such historical periods, we use the exact dates provided without further adjustment unless specified otherwise.

Therefore, the number of years between the establishment of Italian Eritrea and the abolition of the Ethiopian Empire's monarchy is 85 years.

","To determine when the second Launch Pad became operational, we need to find the first launch conducted from this pad. The table provides specific information about each launch pad's history. For the Second Launch Pad, the relevant details are listed under ""Second Launch Pad launch history.""

From this section, we can see that the first launch from the Second Launch Pad was on 5 May 2005, which involved the PSLV-G rocket carrying the Cartosat-1 satellite.

Therefore, the second Launch Pad likely became operational around or before this date, but the exact commissioning date isn't provided. Based on standard practices, it's reasonable to infer that the launch pad would have been operational for some time before its first launch. However, without more precise information, we can conclude that the earliest possible date for the operational status of the second Launch Pad is the date of its first launch.

Final Answer: The second Launch Pad became operational no later than 5 May 2005."

","From the given table, we can see that Antonio Mohamed played for the national team during two periods:

1. In 1989, he played for Argentina U20 for 2 matches.
2. In 1991, he played for the senior Argentina national team for 4 matches.

Since both these appearances were in different years (1989 and 1991), we count each year separately.

Therefore, Antonio Mohamed played for the national team over 2 years.

","To determine over how many years Casey Mears participated in the NASCAR Xfinity Series, we need to look at the information provided for his career in this series.

From the table:
- First race: 2001 GNC Live Well 300 (Homestead)
- Last race: 2017 Ford EcoBoost 300 (Homestead)

The first race was in 2001, and the last race was in 2017. To find out the number of years he participated, we subtract the starting year from the ending year and add one (since both the start and end years count):

2017 - 2001 = 16 years

However, since both years are inclusive, we add one more year:

16 + 1 = 10 years

Therefore, Casey Mears participated in the NASCAR Xfinity Series over 10 years.

","To determine over how many years Dwayne Johnson was an active wrestler, we need to look at the ""Years active"" information provided in the table for his wrestling career.

The ""Years active"" row states:
Years active: 1996-2004; 2011-2013; 2016, (wrestling)

Let's break it down:

1. First period: 1996 to 2004

","To find the difference in years between the planned and elapsed time for the Orbiter's mission duration, we need to follow these steps:

1. Identify the planned mission duration for the Orbiter.
2. Identify the elapsed mission duration for the Orbiter.
3. Convert both durations into years.
4. Calculate the difference between the planned and elapsed durations.

Step 1: The planned mission duration for the Orbiter is about 7.5 years.

Step 2: The elapsed mission duration for the Orbiter is given as 2 years, 10 months.

Step 3: Converting the elapsed mission duration into years:
- 2 years remain as 2 years.
- 10 months can be converted to years by dividing by 12 (since there are 12 months in a year):
  - 10 months ÷ 12 = approximately 0.83 years
- Adding the two values together:
  - 2 years + 0.83 years = approximately 2.83 years

Step 4: Calculating the difference:
- Planned duration: 7.5 years
- Elapsed duration: 2.83 years
- Difference: 7.5 years - 2.83 years ≈ 4.67 years

Rounding up, the difference is 5 years.

","To determine which year since 2013 Chen Yufei did not win a medal in badminton, we need to review her medal-winning years from the provided table.

Firstly, let's list out the years she won medals in major competitions:
- 2013: Asian Junior Championships (Mixed team, Girls' singles, Mixed team)
- 2014: World Junior Championships (Mixed team, Mixed team), Asian Junior Championships (Mixed team, Girls' singles, Mixed team)
- 2015: World Junior Championships (Mixed team), Asian Junior Championships (Mixed team)
- 2016: World Junior Championships (Girls' singles, Mixed team), Asian Junior Championships (Girls' singles, Mixed team)
- 2017: World Championships (Bronze medal), Sudirman Cup (Silver medal), Asian Games (Silver medal), Asian Junior Championships (Mixed team)
- 2018: Uber Cup (Silver medal), Asian Team Championships (Silver medal), Asian Junior Championships (Mixed team)
- 2019: World Championships (Bronze medal), Sudirman Cup (Gold medal)
- 2020: Olympic Games (Gold medal), Uber Cup (Gold medal)
- 2021: Sudirman Cup (Gold medal)
- 2022: Uber Cup (Bronze medal)

From this list, we see that every year from 2013 onwards, Chen Yufei has won at least one medal, except for 2019 where she only won one bronze medal in the World Championships. However, she still won a gold medal in the Sudirman Cup in the same year. 

The year missing from the list of years she won medals is 2019 if we consider only specific types of medals or events, but based on the data given, every year from 2013 onward has at least one medal event.

However, if we strictly follow the question asking for a year without any medals, we need to identify a gap. Since every listed year has at least one medal, it implies there isn't a year between 2013 and 2022 where she didn't win any medal according to the provided information.

Final Answer: Based on the information provided, there is no specific year between 2013 and 2022 where Chen Yufei did not win any medal in badminton."

Vehicle information

Launch vehicle(s)	Space Shuttle

","To determine how many years passed between the Space Shuttle's first flight and its first crewed flight, we'll follow these steps:

1. Identify the date of the first flight.
2. Identify the date of the first crewed flight.
3. Calculate the difference between these two dates.

Step 1: The first flight was ALT-12 on August 12, 1977.

Step 2: The first crewed flight was STS-1 on April 12, 1981.

Step 3: To calculate the difference:
- From August 12, 1977 to August 12, 1981 is exactly 4 years.
- Since the first crewed flight happened on April 12, 1981, which is before August 12, 1981, we need to subtract one year from the initial 4-year estimate.

Therefore, the difference is 3 years and 8 months.

However, the question asks for the number of years. Typically, when asking for years between events, we consider full years, not partial years. Thus, we can say that the first crewed flight occurred approximately 4 years after the first flight, rounding up since it's more than half of the fourth year.

","To determine whether the inflation rate in France was higher in 2020 or 2018, we need to compare the respective inflation rates for these years provided in the table.

Step 1: Identify the inflation rates for 2020 and 2018.
- For 2020: The inflation rate is given as 0.5%.
- For 2018: The inflation rate is given as 2.1%.

Step 2: Compare the two rates.
- In 2020, the inflation rate was 0.5%.
- In 2018, the inflation rate was 2.1%.

Since 2.1% is greater than 0.5%, the inflation rate was higher in 2018 compared to 2020.

Final Answer: The inflation rate in France was higher in 2018."

","To determine the age at which Paul Gauguin died, we need to follow these steps:

1. Identify Gauguin's birth year from the information provided.
2. Identify Gauguin's death year from the information provided.
3. Calculate his age at the time of death by subtracting his birth year from his death year.

Step 1: From the table, Paul Gauguin was born on 7 June 1848.

Step 2: According to the table, he died on 8 May 1903.

Step 3: To calculate his age:
- Death year: 1903
- Birth year: 1848
- Age at death = 1903 - 1848 = 55 years old

However, since he died before his birthday in 1903, he had not yet turned 55. Therefore, he was 54 years old when he died.

Final Answer: Paul Gauguin died at the age of 54."

Dolly Parton concert chronology

Backwoods Barbie Tour | (2008) | Better Day World Tour | (2011) | Blue Smoke World Tour | (2014)

","To find the average length of time between Dolly Parton's tours, we need to consider the start dates of each tour mentioned in the concert chronology.

1. Backwoods Barbie Tour: The start date isn't provided directly, but we know it occurred before the Better Day World Tour.
2. Better Day World Tour: July 17, 2011.
3. Blue Smoke World Tour: The start date isn't provided directly, but we know it happened after the Better Day World Tour.

Since we don't have exact dates for the Backwoods Barbie Tour and Blue Smoke World Tour, we can only calculate the time between the Better Day World Tour and infer the average based on the available information.

Step 1: Calculate the time between the Better Day World Tour and Blue Smoke World Tour.
The Better Day World Tour ended on December 1, 2011. Assuming the Blue Smoke World Tour started around 2014 (as per the chronology), let's use 2014 as the start year.
Time between tours = 2014 - 2011 = 3 years

Step 2: Estimate the time between the Backwoods Barbie Tour and Better Day World Tour.
Since the Backwoods Barbie Tour is listed as happening in 2008, we can estimate the time between these two tours:
Time between tours = 2011 - 2008 = 3 years

Step 3: Calculate the average time between tours.
We have two intervals: 3 years and 3 years.
Average time = (3 + 3) / 2 = 6 / 2 = 3 years

Final Answer: The average length of time between Dolly Parton's tours is 3 years."

","To find the time difference in years between the first and last launch at Site 200/39, we need to:

1. Identify the dates of the first and last launches.
2. Calculate the difference between these two dates.
3. Round the result to the nearest year.

Step 1: Identifying the dates:
- First launch at Site 200/39: 20 February 1980
- Last launch at Site 200/39: 13 December 2021

Step 2: Calculating the difference:
From 20 February 1980 to 13 December 2021, we can calculate the number of years, months, and days that have passed.

- Years: 2021 - 1980 = 41 years
- Months: From February to December is 10 months
- Days: From the 20th of February to the 13th of December is less than a full month, so it's less than a full year.

Since we have 41 full years plus additional months and days, but not a complete extra year, we round down to 41 years.

Step 3: Rounding to the nearest year:
The result from Step 2 is already in whole years, so no further rounding is needed.

Final Answer: 41 years"

","To find the time difference in years between the first and last launch at site 200/40, we need to follow these steps:

1. Identify the dates of the first and last launches for site 200/40.
2. Calculate the difference between these two dates.
3. Round the result to the nearest year.

Step 1: Identifying the dates:
- First launch: 23 July 1977
- Last launch: 31 March 1991

Step 2: Calculating the difference:
To calculate the difference, we can subtract the earlier date from the later date. Since we're dealing with years, we'll focus on the years part of each date, but keep in mind that we need to account for the months and days as well for accuracy.

From 23 July 1977 to 31 March 1991:
- Years difference: 1991 - 1977 = 14 years
- We also need to check if there's any partial year due to the specific months and days:
  - From 23 July 1977 to 31 December 1977: about 5 months
  - From 1 January 1991 to 31 March 1991: about 3 months
  - Total additional time: 8 months which is less than a full year, so it doesn't change the rounding.

Step 3: Rounding the result:
Since the additional 8 months do not complete another year, the difference remains at 14 years when rounded to the nearest year.

Final Answer: The time difference in years between the first and last launch at site 200/40, rounded to the nearest year, is 14 years."

- Second appearance: Not explicitly mentioned, but implied by ""first in 2019-2021"" means this is their second appearance, and it must be after 2019-2021.

Since only one specific period is given for their World Test Championship appearances, we can assume that the time span is from the start of their first appearance in 2019 to the end of their second appearance in 2021.

Now, calculate the duration:
- Start year: 2019
- End year: 2021

Duration = End year - Start year + 1 (since both start and end years are inclusive)
= 2021 - 2019 + 1

His birth date is given as 30 July 1966.

Now, let's calculate his age in 1996:
- The difference between 1996 and 1966 is 30 years.
- Since the championship took place in 1996 and he was born on July 30, 1966, he would have turned 30 that year or shortly after, depending on the exact date of the event.

Next, we need to determine Shabalin's age in 2010. The table states that Shabalin was born on January 25, 1982. 

To calculate his age in 2010:
- From 1982 to 2010 is 28 years.
- Since the Winter Olympics were held in February or March, and Shabalin's birthday is in January, he had already turned 28 by the time of the event.

","To find the difference in days between the planned and elapsed time for the Vikram lander's mission duration, we need to follow these steps:

1. Identify the planned mission duration for the Vikram lander.
2. Identify the elapsed time for the Vikram lander's mission.
3. Convert both durations into days.
4. Calculate the difference between the two values.

Step 1: The planned mission duration for the Vikram lander is ≤ 14 days.

Step 2: The elapsed time for the Vikram lander's mission is given as 0 days due to landing failure.

Step 3: We need to convert the planned mission duration into days. Since it's stated as ≤ 14 days, we'll use 14 days as the maximum possible planned duration.

Difference = Planned Duration - Elapsed Duration
Difference = 14 days - 0 days
Difference = 14 days

Therefore, the difference in days between the planned and elapsed time of the Vikram Lander mission duration is 14 days.

Final Answer: 14 days"

","To determine the first year someone could enter the Birmingham-Jefferson Convention Complex, we need to look at the information provided about when it became operational.

From the table:
- The ""Opened"" row shows ""January 1972""
- The ""Inaugurated"" row shows ""1976""

Since the building opened in January 1972, this means people could start entering the facility from that month onwards. The inauguration in 1976 likely refers to a formal opening ceremony or significant milestone but does not represent the initial availability for entry.

Therefore, the first year that someone could enter the Birmingham-Jefferson Convention Complex was 1972.

","To find the longest span between championships in One Day International (ODI) cricket for Australia, we need to identify all the championship years mentioned in the table and calculate the time spans between them.

From the table:
- Australia has won the ODI World Cup five times.
- The championship years provided are 1987, 1999, 2003, 2007, and 2015.

Now, let's list these years and calculate the intervals between consecutive championships:

1. From 1987 to 1999: 
   1999 - 1987 = 12 years

2. From 1999 to 2003: 
   2003 - 1999 = 4 years

3. From 2003 to 2007: 
   2007 - 2003 = 4 years

4. From 2007 to 2015: 
   2015 - 2007 = 8 years

The largest interval among these is 12 years, which occurred between the championships in 1987 and 1999.

","To determine the year when Argentina became World Cup champions for the first time, we need to look at their best results in the World Cup section of the table.

The table shows:
- Appearances: 17 (first in 1930)
- Best result: Champions (1978, 1986)

From this information, we can infer that while Argentina has won the World Cup twice, in 1978 and 1986, these aren't necessarily the first time they were champions. To find the first time they became champions, we need to check if there's any additional information provided about the years before 1978.

Since no other years are mentioned for winning the World Cup and 1978 is listed as one of the earliest years, we conclude that 1978 was indeed the first year Argentina became World Cup champions based on the given data.

However, typically, when a country wins a championship for the first time, it would be the earliest year mentioned. Therefore, the correct interpretation should consider if there's any hidden assumption or missing data. Given the explicit mention of 1978 and no earlier years, the safest conclusion from the provided data is:

- 1998: 2 bronze medals (World) + 2 bronze medals (Brazilian) = 4 medals
- 1999: 1 gold medal (World) + 1 gold medal (Brazilian) = 2 medals

Followed by	Joey | (2004-2006) | Friends: The Reunion | (2021)

","To find out the year Wil Calhoun was an executive producer of Friends, we need to follow these steps:

1. Locate the relevant information about executive producers from the provided table.
2. Identify when Wil Calhoun was listed as an executive producer.
3. Determine the specific year or range of years he was involved.

Step 1: From the table, under the Production section, we can see the list of executive producers:
David Crane | Marta Kauffman | Kevin S. Bright | Michael Borkow (season 4) | Michael Curtis (season 5) | Adam Chase (seasons 5-6) | Greg Malins (seasons 5-7) | Wil Calhoun (season 7) | Scott Silveri (seasons 8-10) | Shana Goldberg-Meehan (seasons 8-10) | Andrew Reich (seasons 8-10) | Ted Cohen (seasons 8-10)

Step 2: We can see that Wil Calhoun is specifically noted as being an executive producer during season 7.

Step 3: To determine the year for season 7, we refer to the Original release date given at the end of the Production section:
Original release September 22, 1994 - May 6, 2004

Based on this information, we can deduce that season 7 would be within the middle years of the show's run. Since Friends ran for 10 seasons from 1994 to 2004, season 7 would be in 2000-2001 timeframe.

Therefore, Wil Calhoun was an executive producer of Friends during the 2000-2001 season.

Final Answer: Wil Calhoun was an executive producer of Friends in 2000-2001."

","The question asks for the year the Palace of Westminster was built. Looking at the table, there's a row specifically labeled ""Built"" which provides this information.

Step 1: Locate the ""Built"" row in the table.
Step 2: Read the value associated with ""Built"".
The value given is ""1016"".

However, we should verify if this is correct or if it refers to the original structure that was rebuilt later. The table also mentions a ""Rebuilt"" period from ""1840-1876"", indicating that the current structure is a reconstruction due to a fire in 1834.

Step 3: Check for any contradictory information.
The year 1016 seems to refer to an earlier structure, not the current one. Given the context of the rebuild, we need to confirm the actual construction period of the current palace.

Step 4: Conclude based on available data.
Since the table explicitly states the rebuilding period as ""1840-1876"" and the demolition due to fire in ""1834"", the correct answer must be the start of the rebuilding period, which is 1840.

Final Answer: The Palace of Westminster was built starting in 1840."

","The provided information does not explicitly mention when the Satish Dhawan Space Centre was named. However, we can infer the naming date based on other details:

1. The space center has been operational since at least 1979, as indicated by the first launch on 9 August 1979.
2. It's common for space centers to be named after significant figures in science or technology after their contributions or after they have passed away.
3. Satish Dhawan was a prominent Indian scientist who contributed significantly to India's space program and passed away on 30 July 2002.

Given these points, it is reasonable to conclude that the space center would have been named after Satish Dhawan posthumously. Therefore, the most likely time frame for the naming of the center would be shortly after his death in 2002.

Final Answer: The Satish Dhawan Space Centre was most likely named around 2002, following the death of Satish Dhawan."
