","To determine when the next orbital period will begin starting from the time of perihelion, we need to add the length of one complete orbital period to the date of the most recent perihelion.

From the table, the date of the most recent perihelion is given as 2042-Sep-04.
The orbital period of Neptune is given as 164.8 years.

Adding 164.8 years to the perihelion date of 2042-Sep-04 gives us approximately the start of the next orbital period.

Since 164.8 years is very close to 165 years, we can approximate adding 165 years to 2042 to find the start of the next orbital period.

2042 + 165 = 2207

Therefore, the next orbital period will begin around the year 2207.

","From the table, we can extract the following information about the military age for different roles in the Australian Defence Force:

- Selection: 16.5 years
- Serve: 17 years
- Deploy: 18 years
- Special Forces Deployment: 19 years

Since the question asks about the age when someone can first be selected, serve, be deployed, and be eligible for selective service, the earliest ages apply here. Note that the term ""selective service"" usually refers to conscription, but since there is no conscription in Australia, this likely refers to eligibility for different roles within the military.

For selection: 16.5 years
For serving: 17 years
For being deployed: 18 years

Since the question is asking for the first possible age, the answer would be the earliest age given, which is 16.5 years for selection.

Final Answer: 16.5 years for selection, 17 years to serve, 18 years to deploy. The youngest age mentioned is 16.5 years for selection."

To find his age during the 1990 Beijing Asian Games, we calculate the difference between 1990 and 1968:
1990 - 1968 = 22 years.

Since the exact date of the games isn't specified but typically they would occur around the middle of the year, and given he was born in July, we can reasonably conclude that in 1990, he had already turned 22.

Now, let's calculate his age when he joined the national team:
1. Subtract his birth year from the year he joined the national team: 
   1989 - 1968 = 21

Therefore, Dhanraj Pillay joined the National team at the age of 21.

","To find out at what age Dhanraj Pillay started playing for Indian Gymkhana, we need to determine his age in 1992 when he joined this team.

From the personal information section, we know Dhanraj Pillay was born on July 16, 1968.

Now, calculate his age in 1992:
- From July 16, 1992, until his birthday, he would be 1992 - 1968 = 24 years old.
- Since he joined the team in 1992 and presumably before his birthday in July, he would still be considered 24 years old.

","To determine at what age Don Bradman joined his second domestic team, we need to find out when he started playing for his first and second teams and calculate his age at the start of the second one.

From the table, we can see:
- His first domestic team was New South Wales from 1927/28 to 1933/34.
- His second domestic team was South Australia from 1935/36 to 1948/49.
- He was born on 27 August 1908.

Now let's calculate his age when he joined South Australia in 1935/36:
- 1935/36 marks the start of the season, typically meaning he would have started playing for South Australia around the beginning of April 1936 (as cricket seasons often begin in late March or early April).
- By April 1936, Don Bradman had already turned 27 years old (since he was born in 1908).

Therefore, Don Bradman joined his second domestic team, South Australia, at the age of 27.

From the personal information section:
- Born: 27 August 1908

From the international information section:
- Test debut: 30 November 1928

Now calculate the age at test debut:
1. From 27 August 1908 to 30 November 1928, we can count the years and account for the exact days.
2. From August 1908 to November 1928 is 20 full years plus 3 months and 3 days.

So, Don Bradman was approximately 20 years old when he made his test debut for Australia.

","To determine at what age Don Bradman played his last Test, we need to find out when his last Test match was played and subtract this from his birth date.

Step 1: Identify Bradman's birth date.
From the table, we see that Don Bradman was born on 27 August 1908.

Step 2: Identify the date of Bradman's last Test match.
According to the table, his last Test match was on 18 August 1948.

Step 3: Calculate Bradman's age during his last Test.
We need to calculate the difference between 18 August 1948 and 27 August 1908:
- From 27 August 1908 to 27 August 1948 is 40 years.
- Since his last Test was on 18 August 1948, he would be 40 years old minus the days from 18 August to 27 August.
- This means he was 40 years old minus 9 days, effectively meaning he was 40 years old just before turning 41.

Lowest pressure	985 mbar (hPa); 29.09 inHg

['Gaston 2004-08-29 0710Z.jpg | Hurricane Gaston shortly after moving ashore on August 29', '(Extratropical after September 1)']

Part of the | 2004 Atlantic hurricane season

","To determine for how many days Hurricane Gaston was over the water, we need to look at its formation and dissipation dates.

- Formed: August 27, 2004
- Dissipated: September 3, 2004

Now, count the days from August 27 to September 3, inclusive:

1. August 27
2. August 28
3. August 29
4. August 30
5. August 31
6. September 1
7. September 2
8. September 3

Counting these days shows that Hurricane Gaston was active for 7 days total. However, it made landfall on August 29 and moved ashore. Since the exact transition period when it left the water is not specified precisely beyond August 29, we can reasonably conclude it was over water until that day.

Therefore, it was over water from August 27 to August 29, inclusive.

","To find out how long after the Tonnerre was ordered it was commissioned, we need to calculate the time difference between its order date and commission date.

- Ordered: 16 April 1794
- Commissioned: 21 July 1808

First, let's break down the years:
- From 16 April 1794 to 16 April 1808 is exactly 14 years.
- Then we add the remaining days from 16 April 1808 to 21 July 1808.

Now, calculate the days from 16 April to 21 July:
- April has 30 days, so from 16 April to 30 April = 14 days.
- May has 31 days.
- June has 30 days.
- July has 21 days up to the 21st.

So, the total additional days are:
14 (April) + 31 (May) + 30 (June) + 21 (July) = 96 days.

Thus, the total time from ordering to commissioning is 14 years and 96 days.

","The question asks about the duration of the 2022 Atlantic hurricane season, but the data provided is for the 2002 Atlantic hurricane season. Since there is no information given for the 2022 season, I cannot accurately answer the question based on the provided data. However, following the instruction to use the given information and assuming the question meant to refer to the 2002 season, we can calculate the duration of the 2002 season.

From the table, the first system formed on July 14, 2002, and the last system dissipated on October 16, 2002.

To calculate the duration:
- From July 14 to July 31: 18 days (including both start and end dates)
- August has 31 days
- From September 1 to October 16: 46 days

Adding these up gives us 18 + 31 + 46 = 95 days.

Since the question specifically asked about the 2022 season and there's no provided data for it, the correct response should reflect this lack of information.

However, based on the available data for 2002:

- Last Test: 1 December 2007

Step 2: Calculate the number of years.
From 1991 to 2007 is 16 years. Since his career continued beyond just Tests (he played until 2011), we should use his last ODI appearance to be precise.
- ODI debut: 26 December 1989
- Last ODI: 28 June 2011

Step 3: Confirm the total duration.
From 1989 to 2011 is 21 years and 6 months. However, since we're asked for the duration in years, we can round this to the nearest whole number.

In office | 27 April 2012 - 26 April 2018

","To find out how long Sachin Tendulkar was a part of the national side, we need to calculate the difference between his debut and retirement dates.

From the table:
- National side debut: 15 November 1989
- Last Test match: 14 November 2013
- Last ODI match: 18 March 2012

Since he retired from both Tests and ODIs around the same period, we can use the last test match date as the end date for simplicity.

Now, calculating the duration:
- Start Date: 15 November 1989
- End Date: 14 November 2013

Duration = End Date - Start Date
         = 2013 - 1989
         = 24 years

However, since he played his last test match on 14 November 2013 and not 15 November 2013, it means he was part of the national side for slightly less than 24 full years. But typically such durations are rounded to the nearest whole year.

","To find out how many Neptunian solar days are in one Neptunian orbital period, we need to use the information given about the Orbital period and the Sidereal rotation period.

1. From the table, we can see that the Orbital period of Neptune is 164.8 years or 60,195 days.
2. The Sidereal rotation period of Neptune is 0.6713 days or 16 hours, 6 minutes, and 36 seconds, which represents one Neptunian day.

To convert the sidereal rotation period into days:
- 16 hours = 16/24 days
- 6 minutes = 6/1440 days
- 36 seconds = 36/86400 days

Adding them up gives us:
\[ \text{One Neptunian day} = 0.6713 \text{ days} \]

Now, we divide the total number of days in Neptune's orbital period by the length of one Neptunian day:
\[ \frac{60,195 \text{ days}}{0.6713 \text{ days/day}} \approx 89,666 \text{ Neptunian solar days} \]

This result matches the value directly provided in the table under ""Orbital characteristics"" as ""89,666 Neptunian solar days.""

Final Answer: There are 89,666 Neptunian solar days in one Neptunian orbital period."

","Maori was launched on 2 September 1937 and was commissioned on 5 December 1938.

To calculate the number of days between these two dates, we need to consider each month's days:
From September 2, 1937, to December 5, 1938, includes:
- Remaining days in September 1937: 30 - 2 = 28 days
- All days in October, November, and December 1937: 31 + 30 + 31 = 92 days
- All days in January through November 1938: 31 + 28 + 31 + 30 + 31 + 30 + 31 + 31 + 30 + 31 + 30 = 333 days
- Days up to December 5, 1938: 5 days

Adding all these together gives us:

","To determine how many days passed between the launch and the orbital insertion, we need to calculate the difference between the given dates.

1. Launch date: 14 March 2016
2. Orbital insertion date: 19 October 2016

We will count the days from March 14th to October 19th.

First, count the remaining days in March after the 14th:
March has 31 days, so from March 14th to March 31st = 31 - 14 = 17 days.

Then, add the days in April, May, June, July, August, and September:
April: 30 days
May: 31 days
June: 30 days
July: 31 days
August: 31 days
September: 30 days

Sum of days from April to September:
30 + 31 + 30 + 31 + 31 + 30 = 183 days

Finally, count the days from October 1st to October 19th:
October has 31 days, so from October 1st to October 19th = 19 days.

Total days from launch to orbital insertion:
17 (remaining days in March) + 183 (days from April to September) + 19 (days in October up to the 19th) = 219 days.

","To determine how many days passed between the end of the 2022 Purim celebration and the beginning of the 2023 celebration, we need to calculate the difference between their respective dates.

The 2022 Purim date is given as Sunset, 16 March - nightfall, 17 March.
The 2023 Purim date is given as Sunset, 6 March - nightfall, 7 March.

However, since we are calculating the time from the end of one year's celebration to the beginning of the next, we should consider the dates in chronological order.

From the end of the 2022 celebration (nightfall, 17 March) until the beginning of the 2023 celebration (Sunset, 6 March), we must count the days from March 18, 2022, to March 6, 2023.

First, count the remaining days in 2022:
March 18 to December 31 = 31 + 30 + 31 + 31 + 30 + 31 + 31 + 30 + 31 + 30 + 31 - 17 = 334 days

Then add the days from January 1, 2023, to March 6, 2023:
January = 31 days
February = 28 days (assuming it's not a leap year)
March = 6 days

Adding these together gives:
334 + 31 + 28 + 6 = 399 days

Therefore, 399 days passed from the end of the 2022 celebration to the start of the 2023 celebration.

1. From June 1, 1987, to June 1, 2022, is exactly 35 years.
2. Each year has 365 days, so 35 years is 35 * 365 = 12,775 days.
3. From June 1, 2022, to December 31, 2022, is 211 days (considering each month's days: June (30), July (31), August (31), September (30), October (31), November (30), and December (31 - 31 since we're counting up to the end of the year)).

","To calculate the number of days between National Election Day in 2023 and 2024, we need to identify the specific dates and then determine the difference between them.

- The 2023 National Election Day is on November 7.
- The 2024 National Election Day is on November 5.

First, let's find the number of days remaining in 2023 after November 7:
- Days left in November: 23 - 7 = 16 days
- Days remaining in the rest of 2023: 16 + 30 (October) + 31 (September) + 31 (August) + 30 (July) + 30 (June) + 31 (May) + 30 (April) + 31 (March) + 29 (February, assuming it's not a leap year) + 31 (January) = 299 days

Next, let's count the days up to November 5, 2024:
- Days until November 5: 5 days
- Days in the rest of 2024 up to November 5: 5 + 31 (October) + 31 (September) + 30 (August) + 31 (July) + 30 (June) + 31 (May) + 30 (April) + 31 (March) + 29 (February, since 2024 is a leap year) + 31 (January) = 308 days

Now, add the days from the end of 2023 to the beginning of 2024:
- Total days in 2024 from January 1 to November 5: 308 days
- Total days from November 7, 2023, to December 31, 2023: 299 days
- Days in 2024 from January 1 to November 5: 308 days

Finally, calculate the total number of days between November 7, 2023, and November 5, 2024:
- Total days in 2023 from November 7 to December 31: 299 days
- Total days in 20"

","To determine how many days before D-Day the I-179 was sunk, we need to follow these steps:

1. Identify the date when I-179 was sunk.
2. Identify the date of D-Day.
3. Calculate the difference in days between these two dates.

Step 1: According to the table, I-179 was sunk during sea trials on 14 July 1943.

Step 2: D-Day refers to the Normandy landings on 6 June 1944.

Step 3: Calculating the difference:
- From 6 June 1944 to 14 July 1943 is a period spanning across different months and years.
- Counting backwards from 6 June 1944:
  - 6 June 1944 to 30 June 1944: 24 days
  - Adding July 1944 up to 14 July 1944: 14 days
  - Total days between 6 June 1944 and 14 July 1943: 24 + 365 (1943) + 14 = 403 days

However, since the question asks about days before D-Day, we need to reverse the calculation:
- Days from 14 July 1943 to 6 June 1944: 403 days.

","The event took place from December 3 to December 16. Anna Tunnicliffe won the gold medal, so we can assume she won it sometime during this period. Christmas is celebrated on December 25. To find out how many days before Christmas the earliest possible day she could have won is, we calculate the difference between December 25 and the first day of the event:

December 25 - December 3 = 22 days

This means that Anna Tunnicliffe won the gold medal at least 22 days before Christmas, but since the event lasted until December 16, it could be as few as 9 days before Christmas if she won on the last day of the event.

Since the exact day of the win within the event timeframe is not specified, we can only provide the range of days before Christmas she could have won the gold medal. However, based on the given information, the minimum number of days would be 9 (if she won on December 16).

","To determine how many days later Yom Kippur started in 2022 compared to 2021, we need to compare the dates given in the table.

From the table:
- Yom Kippur in 2021 started at sunset on September 15 and ended at nightfall on September 16.
- Yom Kippur in 2022 started at sunset on October 4 and ended at nightfall on October 5.

Now, calculate the difference between these dates:
- September 15, 2021, to October 4, 2022, spans 19 days in September (from the 15th to the end of the month, which is the 30th) plus 4 days into October.
- Total = 16 days remaining in September + 4 days in October = 19 days.

","To find out how many days were between Kapil Dev's Test debut and his ODI debut, we need to calculate the difference between the dates given for each debut.

His Test debut was on 16 October 1978.
His ODI debut was on 1 October 1978.

Since the ODI debut happened before the Test debut, we need to correct this understanding based on the dates provided. The ODI debut happened 16 days before the Test debut because the Test debut is later in October while the ODI debut is earlier in October.

Calculating the difference:
16 October 1978 - 1 October 1978 = 15 days + 1 day (to account for inclusivity of both dates) = 16 days

However, since the question asks about the days between the Test debut and the ODI debut, and the ODI debut is earlier, the actual interpretation should be reversed to understand the gap in the context of the question. Thus, there were 16 days between the ODI debut and the Test debut, but the question asks the reverse, so technically, it's asking about a negative or non-existent gap if strictly interpreted forward in time.

But based on typical question interpretation, we consider the absolute gap:

","To find out how many months passed between when HMS Argyll was laid down and commissioned, we need to calculate the time difference between March 20, 1987, and May 31, 1991.

Step 1: Calculate the number of full years between the two dates.
From March 20, 1987, to March 20, 1991, is exactly 4 years.

Step 2: Calculate the additional months.
From March 20, 1991, to May 31, 1991, is 2 months and 11 days. Since we're looking for whole months, we'll count this as approximately 3 months (rounding up).

Adding these together, the total time is 4 years and 3 months.

Since there are 12 months in a year, we convert the years to months:
4 years * 12 months/year = 48 months.

Then add the remaining months:
48 months + 3 months = 51 months.

","To determine how many months passed between when HMS Victory was ordered and when it was laid down, we need to calculate the time difference between the two dates.

- Ordered: 14 July 1758
- Laid down: 23 July 1759

First, identify the number of days between these two dates:
- From 14 July 1758 to 23 July 1759 is exactly one year plus nine days (since there are 365 days in a non-leap year).

Now convert this duration into months:
- One year equals 12 months.
- Nine days can be approximated to a fraction of a month. Since a month typically has around 30 days, 9 days is approximately 9/30 = 0.3 months.

Adding these together:
- Total months = 12 + 0.3 ≈ 12.3 months

For simplicity, we can round this to the nearest whole number, which gives us 12 months.

","To determine how many months passed between the launch date and the orbital insertion date, we need to calculate the difference between the two dates.

1. **Identify the launch date:** 
   - Launch date: 14 March 2016

2. **Identify the orbital insertion date:**
   - Orbital insertion date: 19 October 2016

3. **Calculate the time difference:**
   - From March 14 to October 19, we can break it down month by month:
     - March: 16 days remaining (since the launch was on the 14th)
     - April: 30 days
     - May: 31 days
     - June: 30 days
     - July: 31 days
     - August: 31 days
     - September: 30 days
     - October: 19 days

4. **Sum up the days:**
   - Total days = 16 + 30 + 31 + 30 + 31 + 31 + 30 + 19 = 228 days

5. **Convert days into months:**
   - On average, a month has about 30 days.
   - Number of months ≈ 228 / 30 ≈ 7.6 months

Therefore, the Mars orbiter insertion occurred approximately 7.6 months after the launch.

['A photograph of a small, old book with Hebrew text and an illustration on the right-hand page. | 18th-century manuscript of the prayer of Al HaNissim on the miracles of Purim']

","To find how many months separate the 2022 and 2024 celebrations of Purim, we need to look at their respective dates.

- In 2022, Purim is celebrated from Sunset, 16 March to nightfall, 17 March.
- In 2024, Purim is celebrated from Sunset, 23 March to nightfall, 24 March.

Both years fall within the same month, March, but we need to calculate the total time span between these two specific dates across two different years.

From March 17, 2022, to March 23, 2024, we can break this into two parts:
1. From March 17, 2022, to March 23, 2023 (12 months plus 6 days).
2. From March 23, 2023, to March 23, 2024 (another 12 months).

Adding these together gives us a total of 24 months and 6 days. Since the question asks for the number of months, we typically round down to the nearest whole month, unless otherwise specified.

","To find out how many months passed between when the Tonnerre was ordered and when it was laid down, we need to calculate the difference between the dates given for these events.

- Ordered: 16 April 1794
- Laid down: 22 September 1794

First, determine the number of days between these dates:
1. From 16 April to 30 April: 14 days
2. For the remaining months before September, add up the days:
   - May: 31 days
   - June: 30 days
   - July: 31 days
   - August: 31 days
3. Add the days from the beginning of September until the 22nd: 22 days

Total days = 14 + 31 + 30 + 31 + 31 + 22 = 169 days

Next, convert the total days into months. On average, a month has approximately 30 days:
169 days / 30 days/month ≈ 5.63 months

1. **Calculate Kaiō Hiroyuki's 28th birthday:**
   - Born on July 24, 1972.
   - 28th birthday: July 24, 2000.

2. **Identify when he achieved Ōzeki:**
   - Achieved Ōzeki in September 2000.

3. **Calculate the time difference:**
   - From July 24, 2000, to September 2000:
     - July: 6 days remaining in July (since he turned 28 on July 24).
     - August: Full month.
     - September: Partial month until he achieved Ōzeki.

","To determine how many months ago the Federal Defence Forces of Germany took on its current form, we need to calculate the difference between the current date (December 2022) and the date it took its current form (3 October 1990).

Step 1: Calculate the number of years difference.
From October 1990 to December 2022 is 32 years.

Step 2: Calculate the number of months difference within those years.
Since the exact month is not specified in the current date context beyond the year, we can consider the full period in months.
32 years * 12 months/year = 384 months.
However, we need to adjust for the fact that we're counting from October to December, which is 2 months into the next year.
So, 384 - 10 + 12 = 386 months.

- July (1 month)

","The last system dissipated on October 16, 2002. Given the current date is December 2022, we need to calculate how many months have passed since October 2002 until December 2022.

From October 2002 to December 2022 is:
- Years: 2022 - 2002 = 20 years
- Months: 12 (months in each of those 20 years) + December - October = 12 * 20 + 2 = 242 months

However, the question asks specifically about the months elapsed since October 2002 up to December 2022, not the total months including the starting month. Therefore, we count from November 2002 to December 2022:
- 11 months in 2002 (from November to December)
- 12 months per year for 20 years (2003 to 2021)
- 12 months in 2022 (up to December)

Adding these together: 11 + (12 * 20) + 12 = 11 + 240 + 12 = 263 months

But since the question is asking for the difference in months alone, and considering the direct span from October to December, it would be:
- From October 2002 to December 2002: 2 months
- Plus 20 full years: 20 * 12 = 240 months
- Plus December 2022: 1 month

So the total is 2 + 240 + 1 = 243 months.

From the table, we see that in 2021, Hanukkah ended on nightfall, 6 December. The date 3 Tevet falls within this range.

Now let's calculate the time difference:
- From December 6, 2021, to December 6, 2022, is exactly 12 months.
- Since we're asking about 3 Tevet, which would be slightly after December 6, 2021, we can consider it to be around mid-December 2021.

Therefore, from mid-December 2021 to mid-December 2022 is approximately 12 months.

","To determine how many months ago the Federal Defence Forces of Germany were founded, we need to calculate the difference between the current date (December 2022) and the founding date (November 12, 1955).

1. Calculate the difference in years: 
   - From November 12, 1955, to November 12, 2022, is 67 years.
   - From November 12, 2022, to December 1, 2022, is approximately 1 month.

2. Total months:
   - 67 years = 67 * 12 = 804 months

","To determine how many months ago the Israel Defense Forces were founded, we need to calculate the difference between the current date (December 2022) and the founding date (May 26, 1948).

Step 1: Calculate the number of years since the founding.
From May 26, 1948, to May 26, 2022, is 74 years. Since it is now December 2022, we add 6 more months to reach December 2022.
So, total years = 74 + 0 (since we're still within the same year of 2022) = 74 years.

Step 2: Convert years to months.
74 years * 12 months/year = 888 months.

Since we have already accounted for the full year of 2022 up until December, there's no need to subtract any additional months for the remaining part of the year.

Final Answer: 888 months"

","Based on the information provided in the table, HMS Montrose was launched on 31 July 1992 and was commissioned on 2 June 1994. Therefore, we need to calculate the number of months between these two dates.

First, let's find the difference in years:
From 31 July 1992 to 31 July 1994 is exactly 2 years.

Next, we calculate the remaining period from 31 July 1994 back to 2 June 1994:
This is approximately 1 month and 2 days.

Adding these together gives us a total of about 2 years and 1 month. Since there are 12 months in a year, we convert this into months:
2 years * 12 months/year = 24 months
Plus the additional month gives us 25 months.

However, since the question asks specifically how many months it took from the launch in 1992 until commissioning in 1994, and the launch date was 31 July 1992 while the commissioning date was 2 June 1994, we need to calculate the exact span.

From July 1992 to June 1994 is exactly 23 months (since June 1994 would be the 23rd month).

","To find out how many months the I-179 lasted after being completed, we need to calculate the time difference between its completion and when it sank during sea trials.

- Completion date: 18 June 1943
- Date sank during sea trials: 14 July 1943

From June 18th to July 14th is less than a full month but more than half a month. Specifically:
- From June 18 to June 30: 12 days
- From July 1 to July 14: 14 days
- Total days: 12 + 14 = 26 days

Since there are approximately 30 days in a month, 26 days is roughly equivalent to about 0.87 months (26/30).

","The mission duration for the ExoMars 2016 Trace Gas Orbiter is planned to be 7 years. As of December 2022, the elapsed time since its launch is 6 years, 3 months, and 18 days. 

To find out how much time is left in the mission as planned, we need to subtract the elapsed time from the total planned mission duration.

Step 1: Convert the planned mission duration into months.
7 years = 7 * 12 = 84 months

Step 2: Convert the elapsed time into months.
6 years = 6 * 12 = 72 months
72 months + 3 months = 75 months

Step 3: Subtract the elapsed time from the total planned mission duration.
84 months - 75 months = 9 months

Final Answer: There are 9 months left in the ExoMars mission as planned."

","To find out how many more days there were between the Western and Eastern Easter dates in 2024 compared to 2022, we need to calculate the difference for both years.

For 2024:
Western Easter date: March 31
Eastern Easter date: May 5
Difference: May 5 - March 31 = 4 days (since May starts on the 5th day after March 31)

For 2022:
Western Easter date: April 17
Eastern Easter date: April 24
Difference: April 24 - April 17 = 7 days

Now, let's compare the differences:
2024 difference: 4 days
2022 difference: 7 days
More days in 2022 compared to 2024: 7 - 4 = 3 days

","The mission duration is listed as ""Planned: 7 years | Elapsed: 6 years, 3 months, 18 days"". Given the current date is December, 2022, we need to calculate how much longer the mission is planned to last.

First, determine how much time has already elapsed since the start of the mission:
- The mission started on 14 March 2016.
- As of December 2022, the mission has been running for approximately 6 years, 9 months.

Next, calculate the remaining duration:
- The mission is planned to last 7 years in total.
- Subtract the elapsed time (6 years, 3 months, 18 days) from the total planned duration (7 years).

7 years - 6 years, 3 months = 0 years, 9 months.

Since the mission has already run past 6 years, 3 months, the remaining duration is:
- 9 months - 3 months, 18 days ≈ 5 months and 11 days (considering only full months for simplicity).

Therefore, the mission is planned to last about 5 more months.

","To determine how many more years the Malayan Emergency lasted after the independence of the Federation of Malaya, we need to follow these steps:

1. Identify the start and end dates of the Malayan Emergency:
   - Start Date: 16 June 1948
   - End Date: 31 July 1960

2. Identify the date of the Federation of Malaya's independence:
   - Independence Date: 31 August 1957

3. Calculate the time difference between the end of the emergency and the independence date:
   - From 31 August 1957 to 31 July 1960

Now, let's break it down year by year:
- From 31 August 1957 to 31 August 1958: 1 year
- From 31 August 1958 to 31 August 1959: 1 year
- From 31 August 1959 to 31 July 1960: 11 months (less than a year)

Adding up the full years gives us 2 years.

","The given information states that the mentioned IBSF World Championships took place in 2017. The schedule indicates that the championships follow a cycle with the previous one held in 2016 and the next one scheduled for 2019. Given that it is currently December 2022, we need to find out when the next championships will occur after 2019 based on this cycle.

Since the last mentioned championship in the schedule is in 2019, and no other specific future dates are given, we can infer that the next championship would be following the typical 2-year interval seen between 2016 and 2017 and 2017 and 2019.

So, if the last known championship was in 2019, and assuming the pattern continues:
2019 + 2 years = 2021
But since 2021 is not mentioned and we're currently in 2022, the next championship would logically be in 2023.

Now, calculate the duration each was a belligerent:
- Rhodesia's duration: 1979 - 1965 = 14 years
- FROLIZI's duration: 1979 - 1978 = 1 year

Finally, find the difference in years:

","To determine how many total years Kimi Räikkönen competed, we need to consider both his Formula One and World Rally Championship careers.

For Formula One:
His active years were 2001-2009 and 2012-2021.
From 2001 to 2009: 2009 - 2001 + 1 = 9 years
From 2012 to 2021: 2021 - 2012 + 1 = 10 years
Adding these together gives us 9 + 10 = 19 years.

For World Rally Championship:
His active years were 2009-2011.
From 2009 to 2011: 2011 - 2009 + 1 = 3 years

However, since some of his WRC years overlap with his F1 career, we only count the additional unique years:
Unique years for WRC: 3 - 1 (overlap with 2009 in F1) = 2 additional years

Therefore, the total years he competed is 19 (F1) + 2 (WRC unique years) = 21 years.

","To calculate the total number of years Michael Schumacher was active in his Formula One career, we need to consider both periods mentioned in the ""Active years"" section:

1. First period: 1991-2006
2. Second period: 2010-2012

For the first period:
From 1991 to 2006 is a span of 16 years (2006 - 1991 + 1).

For the second period:
From 2010 to 2012 is a span of 3 years (2012 - 2010 + 1).

Adding both periods together:
16 years + 3 years = 19 years.

Final Answer: 19 years"

","Jenson Button's last win in Formula One was on October 28, 2012, during the Brazilian Grand Prix. His last Formula One race was on May 28, 2017, at the Monaco Grand Prix. 

To calculate how many years passed between these two events, we need to find the difference between the years of these dates: 2017 - 2012 = 5 years.

However, since we are looking for the duration after his last win until the end of his career, we must note that his last win happened before the start of 2013, and he retired at the end of 2017. Therefore, the correct period spans from 2013 through 2017, which is 5 full years.

To calculate the number of years between his debut and death, we can subtract the debut year from the death year: 2016 - 1970 = 46 years. However, since he debuted in September and died in July, he had not completed his 46th year in sumo when he died. Thus, it is more accurate to say he died 45 years and almost a full year after his debut.

For simplicity and precision in counting full years, we use 46 years minus one year due to the months involved:

","HMS Montrose was ordered in July 1988 and launched on 31 July 1992. To calculate how many years passed between these dates, we can subtract the start year from the end year:

1992 - 1988 = 4 years

However, since the launch date is in July 1992 and the order date is in July 1988, we need to account for the full years between these months. Thus, the time from July 1988 to July 1992 is exactly 4 years.

","To determine how many years passed between when HMS Victory was ordered and when it participated in the Battle of Cape Spartel, follow these steps:

1. Identify the order date of HMS Victory: 14 July 1758.
2. Identify the date of the Battle of Cape Spartel: 1782.

Now calculate the difference in years:

- From 14 July 1758 to 14 July 1782 is exactly 24 years.
- Since the Battle of Cape Spartel took place in 1782, we confirm that it happened within this period.

Therefore, HMS Victory participated in the Battle of Cape Spartel approximately 24 years after it was ordered.

","HMS Somerset was laid down on 12 October 1992 and launched on 25 June 1994. To calculate how many years passed between these dates, we need to consider the difference between 1992 and 1994, which is 2 years. Since both events occurred in different months within those years, we can conclude that it took slightly less than 2 years but for full years, it is considered as 1 complete year had fully passed plus part of the second year.

However, typically such questions ask for full years completed. Therefore, we say it took just over 1 year and into the second year, but strictly in terms of full years, it's noted as starting its second year when launched.

For the sake of clarity and typical reporting in such contexts, we generally count the full years that have completely passed.

","To find out how many years passed between when HMS Victory was laid down and when it was launched, we need to calculate the difference between the dates given for these events.

HMS Victory was laid down on 23 July 1759.
It was launched on 7 May 1765.

Now, let's calculate the difference:

From 23 July 1759 to 23 July 1765 is exactly 6 years.
Since 7 May 1765 is before 23 July 1765, we need to subtract one year from the total:
7 May 1765 is in the same year as the launch year relative to the laying down date, making it 5 full years plus some extra days.

However, since the question asks for the number of years and not the exact day count, we can safely say it took 5 years and part of the sixth year. Typically, such questions seek the complete years elapsed, thus we conclude it took 5 full years plus a fraction of the sixth year.

Final Answer: 5 years and part of the sixth year, typically rounded or considered as 6 years if counting partial years as whole. For precision in terms of full years, the answer is 5 years."

","To find out how many years passed between when the I-179 was laid down and when it was completed, we need to look at the dates given for those events.

- Laid down: 21 August 1941
- Completed: 18 June 1943

First, calculate the difference in years:
From 1941 to 1943 is 2 full years.

Next, check if there's any additional time within those years:
- From 21 August 1941 to 31 December 1941: 4 months and 10 days
- From 1 January 1943 to 18 June 1943: 5 months and 18 days

Adding these partial periods together:
- Total time in months: 4 + 5 = 9 months
- Total time in days: 10 + 18 = 28 days

Since 9 months and 28 days is less than a year, the total period is just over 2 years.

","To find out how many years passed between when HMS Victory was ordered and when it was launched, we need to calculate the difference between these two dates.

HMS Victory was ordered on 14 July 1758 and launched on 7 May 1765.

1. Calculate the number of days from the order date to the launch date:
   - From 14 July 1758 to 7 May 1765 spans several years, so we'll break this into full years and remaining days.
   
2. Count the full years:
   - From 14 July 1758 to 14 July 1765 is exactly 7 years.
   
3. Determine the additional days:
   - From 14 July 1765 to 7 May 1765, there are 43 days fewer than a full year. 
     (May 7th is 23 days into May, and from July 14th to the end of the year is 152 days, so 152 - 23 = 129 days in 1765 before May 7th.)

Since we are only interested in the number of years, we can see that the difference is essentially 6 full years plus some extra days. For the purpose of determining the number of years, we can round to the nearest whole number, but since the question asks specifically about years, we note that the exact period includes part of a seventh year.

Therefore, HMS Victory was launched approximately 7 years after being ordered, considering the fractional year.

Final Answer: 6 years and 299 days (or approximately 7 years)"

From March 1997 to January 2001, four years have passed. To confirm this:
- From March 1997 to March 2001 is exactly 4 years.
- From March 2001 to January 2001 is less than one year, meaning January 2001 falls within that same 4-year period.

","To find out how many years after being refounded Adal was dissolved, we need to calculate the difference between its dissolution date and its refounding date.

Refounding date: 5 November 2020
Dissolution date: 26 April 2022

First, let's count the full years:
- From 5 November 2020 to 5 November 2021 is one year.
- From 5 November 2021 to 26 April 2022 is less than a full year.

Now let's break down the second part:
- From 5 November 2021 to 26 April 2022, there are 6 months and 21 days.

So, the total period is 1 year plus 6 months and 21 days. Since the question asks for the number of years, we can approximate this as slightly more than 1.5 years but not reaching 2 years.

Final Answer: Adal was dissolved approximately 1.5 years after being refounded. For a precise answer in terms of years, we can say about 1.5 years. However, if you need a whole number, the closest whole number would be 1 year since it hasn't reached 2 years yet."

","To find how many years passed between Yamamoto playing for Kyoto Purple Sanga and Ococias Kyoto AC, we need to look at the timeline of his senior career.

From the table, we can see:
- Yamamoto played for Kyoto Purple Sanga from 2001 to 2001.
- He then moved to Mito HollyHock in 2002.
- After various teams, he ended up at Ococias Kyoto AC in 2018.

Counting the years between his last appearance with Kyoto Purple Sanga (2001) and his first appearance with Ococias Kyoto AC (2018):

2018 - 2001 = 17 years

Therefore, it was 17 years after playing for Kyoto Purple Sanga that Yamamoto played for Ococias Kyoto AC.

","To determine how many years passed between when HMS Astute was ordered and when the picture was taken, we need to identify both dates. 

From the table:
- HMS Astute was ordered in March 1997.
- The image of HMS Astute is listed under the ""Name"" field, but no specific date of when the photograph was taken is given.

Since no specific date for the photograph is provided, we can only use the launch date (8 June 2007) as a reasonable proxy for when the picture might have been taken, considering it's a significant milestone in the ship's construction.

Step-by-step calculation:
1. Order date: March 1997
2. Launch date: 8 June 2007
3. Calculate the difference: 2007 - 1997 = 10 years

However, since the exact month and day are not specified for the photograph, we cannot pinpoint the exact number of years with certainty. We can say that the photograph was taken sometime after the order was placed and before or around the launch date.

Final Answer: Approximately 10 years (assuming the photograph was taken around the launch date)."

","To find out how many years after the I-179 was laid down until it was completed, we need to calculate the time difference between its laying down date and completion date.

Laying down date: 21 August 1941
Completion date: 18 June 1943

From August 1941 to June 1943 is 1 year and 10 months. Since there are 12 months in a year, 10 months is approximately 0.83 years. Therefore, the total time is about 1 + 0.83 = 1.83 years.

However, typically such calculations are rounded to whole numbers when dealing with shipbuilding timelines. So, we can round this to 2 years for simplicity and accuracy in context.

- Stricken: 15 April 1944
- Scrapped: 1957 (after being salvaged)

Now calculate the difference between these two dates:

1. Identify the year the ship was stricken: 1944.
2. Identify the year the ship was scrapped: 1957.
3. Subtract the year the ship was stricken from the year it was scrapped: 
   \[
   1957 - 1944 = 13
   \]

Therefore, the I-179 was scrapped 13 years after it was stricken.

- Start date of the Malayan Emergency: 16 June 1948
- Clement Attlee's tenure ended: 1951

","To find how many years have passed since Neptune's discovery until its time of perihelion, we need to calculate the difference between the discovery date and the given perihelion date.

1. Discovery date of Neptune: 23 September 1846
2. Time of perihelion: 4 September 2042

Now, let's calculate the difference:

- Years from 1846 to 2042 = 2042 - 1846 = 196 years
- Since both dates are in September, there is no need to adjust for months or days.

Therefore, it will be 196 years after Neptune's discovery when it reaches its next perihelion in 2042.

","To find out how many years passed between the ordering and launching of HMS Argyll, we need to calculate the difference between the dates given for these events.

1. Ordered: September 1986
2. Launched: 8 April 1989

From September 1986 to September 1989 is 3 years. Since the ship was launched in April 1989, which is before September 1989, we need to subtract one month from this period.

However, since we're dealing with years, we can simplify this calculation by just considering the full years:

- From September 1986 to September 1989 is 3 full years.
- Adding the months from September 1989 to April 1990 would be less than a year, so it doesn't add another full year.

Thus, the total time is approximately 3 years.

","To find out how many years ago the sister ship I-176 was salvaged and scrapped, we need to look at the information given about the ship I-179, since no specific data about I-176 is provided. However, the salvage and scrapping date for I-179 can be used as a reference point, assuming sister ships had a similar timeline.

From the table, it states that I-179 was salvaged and scrapped in 1957.

As of now, the current year is December 2022.

To calculate the number of years since 1957:
2022 - 1957 = 65 years

","To find the number of years between Madan Lal's last Test and his ODI debut, we need to look at the dates given for these events and calculate the difference.

1. Madan Lal's ODI debut was on 13 July 1974.
2. His last Test was on 19 June 1986.

Now let's calculate the difference between these two dates:

- The ODI debut happened before the last Test, so we'll subtract the debut date from the last Test date.
- From 13 July 1974 to 13 July 1986 is exactly 12 years.
- Since his last Test was on 19 June 1986, it means he had one more year of Test cricket after his ODI debut.

Therefore, the number of years between his ODI debut and his last Test is 12 years plus the time from 13 July 1986 to 19 June 1986, which is less than a year. For simplicity, we consider full years, thus the difference is effectively 12 years.

","To find out how many years before achieving his highest ranking Paul Coll won gold at the Manchester World Doubles Championships, we need to determine two dates: when he achieved his highest ranking and when he won the gold medal at the Manchester World Doubles Championships.

1. **Identify the date of the highest ranking:** According to the information provided, Paul Coll's highest ranking was No. 1, achieved on 1 March 2022.
   
2. **Identify the date of the gold medal at Manchester World Doubles Championships:** The table shows that Paul Coll won gold at the 2017 Manchester World Doubles Championships.

3. **Calculate the difference in years:** 
   - Highest ranking achievement: 1 March 2022
   - Gold medal win: 2017

Subtract the year of the gold medal win from the year of the highest ranking achievement:
\[ 2022 - 2017 = 5 \]

Therefore, Paul Coll won gold at the Manchester World Doubles Championships 5 years before achieving his highest ranking.

","The war lasted from 4 July 1964 until 12 December 1979. Southern Rhodesia ceased being a belligerent at the end of 1965 when it declared unilateral independence, becoming Rhodesia from 1965 to 1979. 

To calculate how many years before the war ended Southern Rhodesia ceased being a belligerent:
- The war ended on 12 December 1979.
- Southern Rhodesia ceased being a belligerent on 31 December 1965 (when it became Rhodesia).

Subtracting these dates:

","The Congo Crisis lasted from 5 July 1960 to 25 November 1965. The Republic of the Congo (also known as the Democratic Republic of the Congo during this period) stopped being a belligerent in its own right by the end of 1963, when the secessionist regions of Katanga and South Kasai were still active belligerents but no longer supported by the central government.

To calculate how many years before the war ended the Republic of the Congo ceased to be a belligerent, we need to find the difference between the end of 1963 and the end of the conflict in 1965.

1965 - 1963 = 2 years

2007 - 1994 = 13 years

However, since his career started in November 1994 and ended in May 2007, it did not complete the full 13 years. Therefore, we should consider it as 12 years and 6 months.

For simplicity, if we are asked about the number of years, we can say 12 full years plus part of the 13th year. Generally, when counting careers like this, people often round down to the nearest whole year unless specified otherwise.

","To determine how many years it took Jenson Button to win his second championship, we need to look at the years he won championships in both Formula One and Super GT GT500.

From the Formula One World Championship career section, we see:
- First championship: 2009

From the Super GT GT500 Championship career section, we see:
- First championship: 2018

Since there is no mention of a second Formula One championship and the Super GT GT500 championship in 2018 is considered his second championship, we can calculate the time difference between these two events.

2018 - 2009 = 9 years

Therefore, it took Jenson Button 9 years to win his second championship.

From January 1992 to January 1996 is exactly 4 years. Since the commission date is in September 1996, it is slightly less than 4 full years and 9 months.

Therefore, it took approximately 4 years and 9 months for HMS Somerset to be commissioned after being ordered. However, if we are to provide the answer in whole years, we would round this to 5 years.

Next, calculate the time difference between these two dates:
1. From June 25, 1994, to June 25, 1996, is exactly 2 years.
2. From June 25, 1996, to September 20, 1996, is approximately 2 months and 25 days.

Adding these together:

","HMS Victory was laid down on 23 July 1759 and launched on 7 May 1765. To calculate the time taken from when it was laid down until its launch, we need to find the difference between these two dates.

From 23 July 1759 to 23 July 1765 is exactly 6 years. Since the launch happened slightly earlier, on 7 May 1765, it is still within the same year period, meaning it took less than a full year beyond the 6 years from laying down to launching.

Therefore, the duration from when HMS Victory was laid down until it was launched is 6 years.

- Deployment to Bahrain: 14 March 2011
- Deployment to Yemen: 26 March 2015

Next, calculate the time difference between these two dates:

From 14 March 2011 to 14 March 2015 is exactly 4 years. Since the deployment to Yemen occurred on 26 March 2015, which is later in the same year, the total period remains within this 4-year span.

","To determine how many years it took to build HMS Somerset, we need to look at the dates when construction started and finished.

From the table, we can see:
- Laid down (construction started): 12 October 1992
- Launched (roughly when construction finished): 25 June 1994

Now, let's calculate the time difference between these dates:

1. From 12 October 1992 to 25 June 1994 spans a period of about 1 year and 9 months.

Breaking this down further:
- From October 1992 to October 1993 is 1 year.
- From October 1993 to June 1994 is approximately 9 months.

Therefore, the total time taken to build HMS Somerset is 1 year and 9 months.

","To determine how many years the Tonnerre sailed before it was burned down, we need to find the difference between when it was commissioned and when its fate occurred.

Step 1: Identify the commission date.
The Tonnerre was commissioned on 21 July 1808.

Step 2: Identify the date it was burned down.
The Tonnerre was burned and exploded on 12 April 1809.

Step 3: Calculate the time difference.
From 21 July 1808 to 12 April 1809, we can break this into months:
- From 21 July 1808 to 31 December 1808: 5 months and 10 days.
- From 1 January 1809 to 12 April 1809: 3 months and 12 days.
Adding these together gives approximately 9 months.

","To find out how many years elapsed between the laying down and the launching of the Tonnerre, we need to look at the dates given for those events:

- Laid down: 22 September 1794
- Launched: 9 June 1808

First, calculate the difference in years:
1808 - 1794 = 14 years

Then, determine if there are any additional months or days that would add another year to this period. Since September comes after June, we need to consider that the ship was laid down before it was launched in the same year sequence without crossing over into the next year:
From September 1794 to June 1808 does not add an extra year.

Therefore, the number of years between the laying down and the launching is exactly 14 years.

","Adal was originally founded as Birlik on 26 April 2013 and changed its name to Adal on 5 November 2020. To calculate how many years it was known as Birlik, we need to find the difference between these dates:

1. Convert both dates to years:
   - Start date (as Birlik): 26 April 2013
   - End date (change to Adal): 5 November 2020
   
2. Calculate the difference:
   - From 26 April 2013 to 26 April 2020 is exactly 7 years.
   - From 26 April 2020 to 5 November 2020 is approximately 6 months and 10 days, which is less than a year.

Since we're asked for the number of full years Adal was known as Birlik, we consider only the complete years:

","To determine how many years the Chadian Civil War had been ongoing when François Tombalbaye was overthrown and killed in 1975, we need to follow these steps:

1. Identify the start date of the Chadian Civil War: The war began on 1 November 1965.
2. Identify the date François Tombalbaye was overthrown and killed: This occurred in 1975.
3. Calculate the duration of the conflict up to 1975:
   - From 1 November 1965 to 31 December 1965 is approximately 11 months.
   - Adding full years from 1966 to 1974 gives us 9 years.
   - Adding the partial year of 1975 up to the end of the year adds another full year.

Adding these together: 11 months (in 1965) + 9 full years (1966-1974) + 1 year (1975) = 10 years and 11 months.

Since the question asks for the number of years, we can round this down to 10 years.

To calculate the years in service:
1. Current date: December 2022
2. Commissioning date: September 1996

Subtract the commissioning year from the current year:
2022 - 1996 = 26 years

Since the ship was commissioned in September and the current date is December, we can consider it has completed its 26th year in service.

Step 2: Since the current month (December) is later in the year than the start date (August), we do not need to subtract another year.

Therefore, it has been 67 years since the First Sudanese Civil War began.

","Tochiazuma Daisuke debuted in November 1994 and achieved his highest rank of Ōzeki in January 2002. To calculate how many years this took, we need to find the difference between these dates:

From November 1994 to November 2001 is 7 years. Since he reached Ōzeki in January 2002, that adds another few months, but since we're looking at full years into his career, we count it as part of the 7th year until he achieves the rank in the 8th year.

Therefore, it took him 7 full years plus some additional time into his 8th year of his career to achieve his highest rank.

","To determine how many years longer the Arab Socialist Ba'ath Party has existed compared to its paramilitary wing, we need to follow these steps:

1. Identify the founding year of the Arab Socialist Ba'ath Party - Syria Region.
2. Identify the start year of the Ba'ath Brigades (paramilitary wing).
3. Calculate the difference between these two dates.

Step 1: Founding Year
The table states that the Arab Socialist Ba'ath Party - Syria Region was founded on 7 April 1947.

Step 2: Start Year of Paramilitary Wing
According to the table, the Ba'ath Brigades were established in 2012.

Step 3: Calculation
Subtract the start year of the paramilitary wing from the founding year of the party:
1947 - 2012 = -65

Since we are looking for the duration of existence, we consider the absolute value:
|1947 - 2012| = 65 years

Therefore, the Arab Socialist Ba'ath Party has existed 65 years longer than its paramilitary wing.

","To find out how many years longer the Red Brigades were active compared to Workers' Autonomy, we need to look at their respective timeframes listed under ""Belligerents"":

- Red Brigades: 1970-1988
- Workers' Autonomy: 1973-1979

Now, let's calculate the duration of each group's involvement:

Red Brigades: 1988 - 1970 = 18 years
Workers' Autonomy: 1979 - 1973 = 6 years

Finally, subtract the duration of Workers' Autonomy from the duration of Red Brigades:
18 years - 6 years = 12 years

Final Answer: The Red Brigades were active for 12 years longer than Workers' Autonomy."

1. The Communist Party of the Soviet Union was founded on March 8, 1918.
2. It had approximately 19,487,822 members in early 1989.

Now, let's calculate the difference in years:
- From March 8, 1918, to early 1989, there are 70 years and some months. Since the membership milestone is given as ""early 1989,"" we can consider this as just over 70 years.

Therefore, the Communist Party of the Soviet Union was about 71 years old when it had over 19 million members.

","To find out how many years passed between the laying down and the launch of the Tonnerre, we need to look at the dates given for these events.

- Laid down: 22 September 1794
- Launched: 9 June 1808

Now, calculate the difference between these two dates:

1. From 22 September 1794 to 22 September 1808 is exactly 14 years.
2. Since the ship was launched on 9 June 1808, it was less than three months before the end of the 14th year.

Therefore, the period between laying down and launching is just over 13 years but less than 14 years. However, since we typically measure such periods in whole years unless specified otherwise, the answer can be rounded to 13 full years plus part of the 14th year.

Final Answer: 13 years (plus part of the 14th year)"

","To find out how many years passed from the ordering to the launching of HMS Montrose, we need to identify the dates for both events and calculate the difference.

From the table:
- Ordered: July 1988
- Launched: 31 July 1992

Now, calculate the difference between these two dates:
- From July 1988 to July 1992 is exactly 4 years.
- Since the ship was launched on 31 July 1992, which is later in the same month as the order date, we confirm it's an additional 4 years.

Therefore, the total number of years from ordering to launching is 4 years.

Casualties and losses
['10,000 Iraqi soldiers killed', 'Total Casualties: 6,600-10,000 killed, 80,000 displaced']

","Ahmed Hassan al-Bakr's leadership period is listed as 1963. However, this does not specify if he was a leader or commander of Ba'athist Iraq during this entire year. To find out his exact duration as the leader/commander of Ba'athist Iraq, we need to look at the timeline provided by the other leaders listed:

- From 1958 to 1963: Abdul Karim Qasim
- From 1963 to 1966: Ahmed Hassan al-Bakr (this shows he was involved but doesn't confirm Ba'athist Iraq leadership yet)
- From 1963 to 1966: Abdul Salam Arif (suggesting Ahmed Hassan al-Bakr might have been part of the government but not the sole leader)
- From 1966 to 1968: Abdul Rahman Arif

Given that Abdul Salam Arif succeeded Ahmed Hassan al-Bakr and considering the context of the proxy war and the transition of power, Ahmed Hassan al-Bakr became the leader of Ba'athist Iraq in 1968. Therefore, he led Ba'athist Iraq from 1968 onwards until the next leader is mentioned, which is in 1968 (Abdul Rahman Arif).

Since there is no clear indication of when he stopped being the leader within the given information and Abdul Rahman Arif took over in 1968, Ahmed Hassan al-Bakr's term as the leader of Ba'athist Iraq is likely from 1968 to the end of the provided data range.

However, since Abdul Rahman Arif is already noted as taking over in 1968, it means Ahmed Hassan al-Bakr's term as leader of Ba'athist Iraq is only for the partial year of 1968. But typically such leadership terms are considered starting fully from the year they took office unless stated otherwise.

Final Answer: 1 year (from 1968, considering typical full-year leadership terms unless specified otherwise)"

","To find out how many years the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam were active, we need to calculate the difference between their dates of operation.

From the table, we can see that the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam operated from 5 May 1976 to 18 May 2009.

Step 1: Identify the starting date - 5 May 1976
Step 2: Identify the ending date - 18 May 2009
Step 3: Calculate the difference in years between these two dates

The number of full years they were active is calculated by subtracting the starting year from the ending year and adjusting for partial years:

Since both the start and end dates fall within their respective years (May 5, 1976, to May 18, 2009), there is no need to adjust for partial years.

","From the information given, the event occurred in 2011. The table also shows a link to the next championships in 2012 under ""← 2010 | 2012 →"". However, this could mean the next organized championship cycle starts after a gap or it might be a typo since the previous event mentioned is 2010, implying a biennial event pattern. Assuming a regular biennial (every two years) schedule and considering the last event held in 2011, the next event would be expected in 2013. Since the current date is December 2022, the next championship after 2013 would be in 2015, and the one after that in 2017, continuing until the next available year after 2022, which would be 2023. 

Claire Leroy, Elodie Bertrand, and Riou won bronze in 2011. So, if we consider the next possible event in 2023, they would have waited from 2011 to 2023, which is 12 years.

","To find out how much longer Neptune's orbital period is compared to its synodic period, we first need to identify both periods from the given information.

From the table:
- Neptune's Orbital period = 164.8 years or 60,195 days
- Neptune's Synodic period = 367.49 days

Since we're comparing the orbital period to the synodic period, we only need to use the values in days. We can directly subtract the synodic period from the orbital period to find the difference in days:

60,195 days (orbital period) - 367.49 days (synodic period) = 59,827.51 days

Rounding 59,827.51 to the nearest integer gives us 59,828 days.

- Kamatamare Sanuki: 2013-2017

Next, we calculate the duration of time he spent at each club:
- Duration at Mito HollyHock: 2003 - 2002 + 1 = 2 years
- Duration at Kamatamare Sanuki: 2017 - 2013 + 1 = 5 years

Now, we find the difference in years between the two durations:

","To find out how much longer the Bloc of Communists and Non-Partisans served as the national affiliation compared to the duration of Cominform's international affiliation, we need to calculate the time spans for both periods and then subtract one from the other.

Firstly, let's determine the period for the Bloc of Communists and Non-Partisans as the national affiliation:
From 1936 to 1990, which is 1990 - 1936 = 54 years.

Next, let's determine the period for Cominform as the international affiliation:
From 1947 to 1956, which is 1956 - 1947 = 9 years.

Now, subtract the shorter period from the longer period:
54 years - 9 years = 45 years.

Therefore, the Bloc of Communists and Non-Partisans was the national affiliation for 45 years longer than Cominform was the international affiliation.

","To find out how much longer Iraq was an ally compared to Libya during the 1970s, we need to extract the relevant time periods from the information given about each country's alliance with Fatah - The Revolutionary Council.

Iraq was an ally from 1974 to 1978.
Libya was not mentioned as being an ally in the 1970s according to the data provided.

Since Libya does not have any specified alliance period within the 1970s, we can't calculate a difference in duration. However, if we assume the question is asking based on the closest available data for Libya, it became an ally in 1985 and ended its alliance in 1991, but this doesn't fall within the 1970s timeframe.

Therefore, based on the information provided, Iraq was an ally for the full span of the 1970s while Libya had no mentioned alliance during this decade.

","To determine how much longer the LIFEX refit was compared to the Major refit, we need to calculate the duration of each refit period and then find the difference between them.

1. **Major Refit Period:** From 2009 to 2010
   - Start Year: 2009
   - End Year: 2010
   - Duration: 2010 - 2009 = 1 year

2. **LIFEX Refit Period:** From 2015 to 2017
   - Start Year: 2015
   - End Year: 2017
   - Duration: 2017 - 2015 = 2 years

Now, we find the difference in durations:
- Difference: 2 years (LIFEX) - 1 year (Major) = 1 year

Final Answer: The LIFEX refit lasted 1 year longer than the Major refit."

From the table, we know:
- Ali Farag was born on 22 April 1992.
- He turned pro in 2009.

So, subtract the birth year from the year he turned pro: 
2009 - 1992 = 17

However, since he turned professional in 2009 and his birthday is on 22 April, he would have been 17 years old during most of the year 2009, but turned 17 before turning professional if his birthday had already passed.

Since the exact month he turned pro isn't specified and typically players turn pro after their birthday, it is reasonable to conclude he was 17 when he turned professional.

From the information given:
- Brian Lara was born on 2 May 1969.

Now, let's calculate his age at the time of his debut:
- 1990 - 1969 = 21 years.

Since his birthday (2 May) falls before the end of the year, he would have already turned 21 by the time of his debut.

","Eddy Merckx was born on 17 June 1945 and joined his first professional team, Solo-Superia, in 1965.

To find out how old he was when he joined his first professional team, we need to calculate the difference between 1965 and 1945, which is 1965 - 1945 = 10 years.

However, since his birthday is on June 17, and assuming he joined his team sometime after this date in 1965, he would have just turned 10 years old at some point during that year. But typically, professional sports teams consider athletes to be one year older on the calendar year they join rather than the exact age at the time of joining. Therefore, he would be considered to have been 10 years old in terms of completed years but it's more accurate to say he turned 10 during that year.

For clarity in typical contexts, we state he was 10 years old when he joined his first professional team.

","Fernando Alonso won his last Formula One Grand Prix at the 2013 Spanish Grand Prix. According to the information given, Fernando Alonso was born on 29 July 1981. To find out how old he was in 2013, we need to calculate the difference between 2013 and 1981: 2013 - 1981 = 32 years old.

However, since his birthday is on 29 July, we need to consider if the Spanish Grand Prix took place before or after his birthday. Typically, the Spanish Grand Prix happens in late May or early June, which means it would have occurred before his birthday in 2013. Therefore, Alonso was indeed 32 years old when he won the Spanish Grand Prix in 2013.

","To find out how old Francesco Moser was when he rode for Sanson (1976-1980), we need to calculate his age in 1976, since that's the first year he was with the team.

Moser was born on June 19, 1951. So in 1976, he would have turned 25 years old.

Step 1: Calculate the difference between the year Moser started with Sanson and the year he was born.
1976 - 1951 = 25

Step 2: Since Moser had already had his birthday by the time he started with Sanson in 1976, he was 25 years old.

","To determine how old Gagan Ajit Singh was when he began his senior career, we need to look at the earliest year mentioned for his senior career and compare it to his birth year.

From the table, we see that his senior career began in 2005 with HC Klein Zwitserland.

He was born on 9 December 1980.

Since his senior career started in 2005, we calculate his age as follows:
2005 (start of senior career) - 1980 (birth year) = 25 years old.

However, since his birthday is on December 9th, he would have turned 25 during the year 2005, but technically began his senior career before turning 25.

Therefore, he was about to turn 25 or had just turned 25 when he began his senior career, meaning he started his senior career at the age of 25.

","Jenson Button was born on 19 January 1980. His best finish in the Super GT GT500 Championship occurred in 2018 when he achieved first place. 

To calculate how old he was in 2018, subtract his birth year from 2018:
2018 - 1980 = 38 years old

However, since his birthday is on January 19th, we need to consider if his birthday had already passed in 2018 before achieving his best finish. Given that the information doesn't specify a later month or date for his achievement, we can assume it was within the same year but not necessarily post-January 19th. Therefore, he would have turned 38 during the championship year.

- Since the games were held in 1995, Lombi would have turned 24 during the year of the games.

However, since the games were likely held later in the year, Lombi would still be 24 throughout most of the year.

","To find out how old Francesco Moser was when he first rode for Famcucine-Campagnolo, we need to calculate the difference between his joining year and his birth year.

Moser was born on June 19, 1951.
He joined Famcucine-Campagnolo in 1981.

Since his birthday is on June 19, if we're considering the time before June 19, 1981, he would be turning 30, but since the exact date of his joining isn't specified and it's usually considered as starting from the beginning of the year for professional sports careers, we can assume he had already turned 30 by the time he joined Famcucine-Campagnolo.

Therefore, Moser was 30 years old when he first rode for Famcucine-Campagnolo in 1981.

From the table, we know:
- Sanath Jayasuriya was born on 30 June 1969.
- His Test debut was on 22 February 1991.

First, calculate the difference in years:
1991 - 1969 = 22 years

Since his birthday (30 June) had already passed by the time of his debut (22 February), he would have turned 22 just before the debut.

","To determine how old Sean Kelly was when he joined his first professional team, we need to look at two pieces of information: his birth date and the year he joined his first professional team.

From the ""Personal information"" section, we can see that Sean Kelly was born on 24 May 1956.

From the ""Professional teams"" section, we can see that his first professional team was Flandria-Velda-Latina Assicurazioni, starting in 1977.

Now, let's calculate his age when he joined his first professional team:

1. Find out how many years passed from his birth year (1956) to the year he joined his first professional team (1977):
   1977 - 1956 = 21 years.

2. Since his birthday is on May 24th, and he joined his first professional team in 1977, he would have already had his birthday in 1977, making him 21 years old when he joined his first professional team.

Championships	24 (Makuuchi)
Special Prizes	Outstanding Performance (2) | Fighting Spirit (1)

* Up to date as of June 2020.

","To find out how old Toshimitsu Obata was when he became Yokozuna, we need to calculate his age at that time based on his birth date and the date he achieved the Yokozuna rank.

Toshimitsu Obata was born on May 16, 1953. He achieved the Yokozuna rank in July 1974. 

Now, let's determine the difference in years between these dates:
1974 - 1953 = 21 years

Since the exact month and day are not specified for when he became Yokozuna, we can only be sure about the year. However, given that the achievement was in July and his birthday is in May, we know he had already turned 21 by the time he became Yokozuna.

Final Answer: 21 years old"

","To determine the longest period without a major military operation since the inception of the Israel Defense Forces, we need to identify the intervals between listed major operations and find the largest gap.

From the table, the list of major military operations includes:
- 1948 Arab-Israeli War (1948-1949)
- Reprisal operations (1951-1956)
- Sinai War (1956)
- Six-Day War (1967)
- War of Attrition (1967-1970)
- Yom Kippur War (1973)
- Operation Litani (1978)
- First Lebanon War (1982-1985)
- First Intifada (1987-1993)
- Second Intifada (2000-2005)
- Second Lebanon War (2006)
- Operation Cast Lead (2008-2009)
- Pillar of Defense (2012)
- Protective Edge (2014)
- Guardian of the Walls (2021)

We now calculate the gaps between these operations:
- From 1948-1949 to 1951-1956: 2 to 6 years
- From 1956 to 1967: 11 years
- From 1970 to 1973: 3 years
- From 1978 to 1982: 4 years
- From 1985 to 1987: 2 years
- From 1993 to 2000: 7 years
- From 2005 to 2006: 1 year
- From 2009 to 2012: 3 years
- From 2014 to 2021: 7 years

The largest gap identified is from 1956 to 1967, which is 11 years.

","To find the average of the minimum and maximum military age in the Republic of Korea Armed Forces, we first identify those ages from the information given.

The conscription details state that the age range is 18-28 years of age.

Minimum age = 18
Maximum age = 28

To calculate the average, we add the minimum and maximum ages and divide by 2:
Average = (Minimum age + Maximum age) / 2
        = (18 + 28) / 2
        = 46 / 2
        = 23

","To find the difference in days between Black Friday in 2024 and 2022, we need to identify the dates for both years first:

- Black Friday in 2022 is November 25.
- Black Friday in 2024 is November 29.

Next, calculate the difference between these two dates:

1. Both dates are in November, so we can directly compare the days:
   - 2022: November 25
   - 2024: November 29
   
2. Subtract the smaller date from the larger date:
   - 29 - 25 = 4 days

Therefore, Black Friday in 2024 occurs 4 days later than Black Friday in 2022.

","To find the difference in synodic periods between Mars and Earth in years, we need to follow these steps:

1. Identify the synodic period for Mars from the given information.
2. Use the known synodic period for Earth relative to Mars.
3. Convert these periods into years.
4. Calculate the difference.

Step 1: The synodic period for Mars is given as 779.96 days or 2.1354 years.

Step 2: The synodic period of Earth relative to Mars is the time it takes for Earth to lap Mars once in their respective orbits around the Sun. This is the same value as Mars' synodic period relative to Earth, which is 779.96 days or 2.1354 years.

Step 3: Since both periods are already given in years, no conversion is needed.

Step 4: Calculate the difference between Earth's orbital period (1 year) and Mars' synodic period relative to Earth (2.1354 years):
Difference = 2.1354 - 1 = 1.1354 years

","To determine the time difference in months between the two maps, we need to identify their respective dates.

1. The first map (""Deaths per 100,000 residents by department"") has an update date mentioned as ""up to July 2020.""
2. The second map (""Map of positive tests by regions"") has an update date mentioned as ""as of 5 May 2022.""

Next, calculate the time difference between these two dates:

- From May 2022 to July 2020 is 2 years and 2 months. 

Convert this period into months:
- 2 years = 2 * 12 = 24 months
- Adding the additional 2 months gives us 24 + 2 = 26 months.

","The dates for Hanukkah in 2023 are given as Sunset, 7 December - nightfall, 15 December. Since Hanukkah lasts for 8 days starting from 25 Kislev, we can determine the specific date for 28 Kislev by counting forward three days from the start date (since 28 Kislev is three days after 25 Kislev).

Starting date (25 Kislev): December 7, 2023
26 Kislev: December 8, 2023
27 Kislev: December 9, 2023
28 Kislev: December 10, 2023

","In the table, it is mentioned that Sukkot in 2023 will be celebrated from Sunset, 29 September to nightfall, 6 October (7 October outside of Israel). Since the 20th of Tishrei falls on the seventh day of Sukkot, we need to find the date that corresponds to the seventh day within this range.

The first day (15th of Tishrei) is on 29 September, so each subsequent day can be calculated by adding one day to the previous date:

- Day 1 (15th of Tishrei): 29 September
- Day 2 (16th of Tishrei): 30 September
- Day 3 (17th of Tishrei): 1 October
- Day 4 (18th of Tishrei): 2 October
- Day 5 (19th of Tishrei): 3 October
- Day 6 (20th of Tishrei): 4 October
- Day 7 (21st of Tishrei): 5 October

Therefore, the 20th of Tishrei will be celebrated on 4 October 2023.
