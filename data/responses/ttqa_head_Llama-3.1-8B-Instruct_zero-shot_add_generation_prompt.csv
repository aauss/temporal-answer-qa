","To find the approximate number of months after being apprehended that Jeffrey Epstein died by suicide, we need to follow these steps:

1. Identify the date Jeffrey Epstein was apprehended: The table states that Jeffrey Epstein was apprehended on July 6, 2019.
2. Identify the date Jeffrey Epstein died by suicide: The table also states that Jeffrey Epstein died by suicide on August 10, 2019.
3. Calculate the time difference between the two dates: Since Jeffrey Epstein was apprehended on July 6, 2019, and died on August 10, 2019, we need to find the number of days between these two dates.
4. Convert the time difference to months: We will then convert the number of days to months.

Step 1: Identify the dates
- Apprehended date: July 6, 2019
- Death date: August 10, 2019

Step 2: Calculate the time difference
- The time difference between July 6, 2019, and August 10, 2019, is 35 days.

Step 3: Convert the time difference to months
- Since there are approximately 30.44 days in a month, we can divide 35 by "

","To find the planned mission duration of Chandrayaan-2's orbiter, we need to look at the ""Mission duration"" section of the table. It states that the planned mission duration for the orbiter is around 7.5 years.

Next, we need to find the launch date of Chandrayaan-2, which is mentioned in the ""Start of mission"" section. The launch date is 22 July 2019.

To find the year when the planned mission duration would end, we need to add 7.5 years to the launch year. 

2019 + 7.5 years = 2019 + 7 years + 1 year (since 0.5 years is half a year)
= 2026 + 1 year
= 2027

However, the question asks for the year when the planned mission duration would end according to the launch date, which is 22 July 2019. Since the launch date is in July 2019, we should consider the year after 2027, which would be the year when the mission duration ends.

But, we need to add 7.5 years to the launch date's month, not the year. 

So, we add 7.5 years"

Step 1: We need to find the year Adolf von Baeyer married Adelheid Bendemann.
From the table, we see that Adolf von Baeyer married Adelheid Bendemann in the year 1868.

Step 2: We need to find Adolf von Baeyer's birth year to determine his age at the time of marriage.
From the table, we see that Adolf von Baeyer was born on October 31, 1835.

Step 3: We need to calculate Adolf von Baeyer's age at the time of marriage.
To do this, we subtract his birth year from the year he got married: 1868 - 1835 = 33.

","To find the answer, let's break down the information provided in the table step by step.

1. We need to find the year Adolf von Baeyer received the Nobel Prize. Looking at the table, we see that the Nobel Prize for Chemistry was mentioned in the ""Awards"" section.
2. The Nobel Prize for Chemistry is listed as ""(1905)"" in the table. This means Adolf von Baeyer received the Nobel Prize in the year 1905.
3. Now, we need to find Adolf von Baeyer's birth year to calculate his age at the time of receiving the Nobel Prize. His birth date is mentioned as ""31 October 1835"".
4. To calculate his age, we subtract his birth year from the year he received the Nobel Prize. So, 1905 - 1835 = 70.

Therefore, Adolf von Baeyer received the Nobel Prize at the age of 70.

","To determine at what age Stephen Hawking married Elaine Mason, we need to follow these steps:

1. Find the birthdate of Stephen Hawking. The table mentions that Stephen Hawking was born on 8 January 1942.

2. Find the date of marriage to Elaine Mason. The table states that Stephen Hawking married Elaine Mason in 1995.

3. Calculate the age of Stephen Hawking at the time of marriage. We can do this by subtracting the birth year from the year of marriage and then subtracting 1 for the age at the end of that year.

Birth year: 1942
Year of marriage: 1995

","To answer the question, let's follow these steps:

1. Identify the year Tony Stewart was inducted into the NASCAR Hall of Fame.
2. Find the birthdate of Tony Stewart.
3. Calculate the age of Tony Stewart at the time of induction.

From the table, we can see that Tony Stewart was inducted into the NASCAR Hall of Fame in 2020.

His birthdate is May 20, 1971.

To calculate his age at the time of induction, we need to know the current year. Since the current date is December 2022, we can assume that the current year is 2022.

Now, let's calculate the age:

2022 (current year) - 2020 (year of induction) = 2 years (for the years he was inducted)
2022 - 1971 = 51 years (for his age in 2022)

However, the question asks for his age at the time of induction. Since he was inducted in 2020, we need to subtract 2 years from his age in 2022:

51 - 2 = 49

However, this is not the correct calculation. The correct calculation should be:
2022 - 1971 = 51 years

","To find the answer, we need to compare the duration of Steve Austin's marriages to Jeanie Clarke and Kathryn Burrhus.

1. We know that Steve Austin was married to Kathryn Burrhus from 1990 to 1992. 
   The duration of this marriage is 2 years.

2. We know that Steve Austin was married to Jeanie Clarke from 1992 to 1999.
   The duration of this marriage is 7 years.

3. To find the difference in the duration of their marriages, we subtract the duration of the first marriage from the duration of the second marriage:
   Difference = Duration of Jeanie Clarke marriage - Duration of Kathryn Burrhus marriage
   Difference = 7 years - 2 years
   Difference = 5 years

Therefore, Steve Austin was married to Jeanie Clarke for 5 more years than Kathryn Burrhus.

Key dates

20 September 1965	Closed

","To find out for how many years Black Dog Siding operated under its original name, we need to determine the date it was opened as Black Dog Siding and then calculate the time period until it was renamed.

1. We see that Black Dog Siding was opened on 3 November 1863.
2. It was renamed to Black Dog Halt on 8 June 1953.
3. To find out the time period, we need to subtract the opening date from the renaming date. However, since we are looking for the years it operated under its original name, we will subtract the opening year from the renaming year and then consider the months.

Renaming year: 1953
Opening year: 1863

Time period in years: 1953 - 1863 = 90 years

Since the opening date is 3 November 1863, and it was renamed on 8 June 1953, we need to consider the months. The opening date is in November, and the renaming date is in June, which means it operated under its original name for almost 11 months in 1953. However, since we are looking for the years, we will consider the full year 1953 as part of the operation time.

","To find the duration for which Libya supported the Ethiopian Civil War, let's break down the information provided in the table.

1. First, we need to identify the periods during which Libya supported the Ethiopian Civil War. According to the table, Libya supported the war from 1977 to 1985.

2. Next, we need to determine if Libya supported the war during any other periods. The table also mentions that Libya supported the war from 1985 to 1991, but since it already supported the war from 1977 to 1985, this additional information does not extend the duration of Libya's support.

3. Therefore, the total duration for which Libya supported the Ethiopian Civil War is from 1977 to 1985.

Now, let's calculate the duration in years:

- 1985 is the last year of Libya's support.
- 1977 is the first year of Libya's support.
- The duration is 1985 - 1977 = 8 years.

So, Libya supported the Ethiopian Civil War for 8 years.

","To find the answer, let's analyze the given information step by step.

Step 1: Identify the year when the JF-17 Thunder was first produced in Pakistan.
From the table, we see that the ""First flight"" of the JF-17 Thunder was on 25 August 2003, but this is not the production start date. We need to find the production start date.

Step 2: Identify the year when the JF-17 Thunder was first produced in Pakistan.
The table mentions that the JF-17 Thunder is ""In production and in service"" and the production start date in Pakistan is given as ""In Pakistan: January 2008 - present"".

Step 3: Determine the number of years the JF-17 Thunder has been produced in Pakistan.
Since the production started in January 2008 and the current year is 2022, we need to calculate the number of years.

Step 4: Calculate the number of years.
2022 - 2008 = 14 years

Therefore, the JF-17 Thunder has been produced in Pakistan for 14 years.

Since the question asks for the number of years Atlantis was in publication, we should consider the duration of time between the first and last publication.

Step 3: Since the first publication was in 1984, and the last was in 2019, we can calculate the duration by considering 1984 as the starting point. However, the question asks for the number of years Atlantis was in publication. To find this, we can subtract the year of the first publication from the year of the last publication and then add 1 to include the last year of publication.

2. **Identify the date when 20th Century Studios was owned by Walt Disney:** The table states that 20th Century Studios was owned by The Walt Disney Company starting from 2019.

3. **Calculate the time difference between the founding date and the date when 20th Century Studios was owned by Walt Disney:** We need to find the difference between the founding date (May 31, 1935) and the date when it was owned by Walt Disney (2019).

Since the question asks for the time difference, we'll consider the year 2019 as the reference point. To find the difference, we can subtract the founding year from the year 2019.

2019 - 1935 = 84 years

However, we also need to consider the month of May, as the founding date is May 31, 1935. Since 2019 is a non-leap year, it has 365 days.

   - In the table, it is mentioned that ""Years active"" is 1998-present. This means that 1998 is the year he started his career.

2. Now, we need to find out when Cumberbatch married Sophie Hunter.
   - In the table, it is mentioned that he married Sophie Hunter in 2015.

3. To find out how long after he started his career he married Sophie Hunter, we need to subtract the year he started his career from the year he got married.
   - The year he started his career is 1998.
   - The year he got married is 2015.
   - The difference between these two years is 2015 - 1998 = 17 years.

","To find out how long Ingenuity flew on Mars, we need to calculate the total flight time in days.

Step 1: Find the total flight time in minutes and seconds.
From the table, we see that Ingenuity flew for a total of 55 minutes and 23 seconds.

Step 2: Convert the total flight time from minutes and seconds to just hours.
There are 60 seconds in a minute, so we can convert 23 seconds to hours by dividing by 3600 (60 seconds * 60 minutes).
23 seconds / 3600 = 0.00639 hours (approximately)
Now, add this to the total flight time in minutes:
55 minutes + 0.00639 hours = 55.00639 hours (approximately)

Step 3: Convert the total flight time from hours to days.
There are 24 hours in a day, so we can convert the total flight time from hours to days by dividing by 24.
55.00639 hours / 24 = 2.2927 days (approximately)

However, the flight time is given as 55 minutes, 23 seconds which is approximately 0.9274 days (since 55 minutes is 0.9167 days and 23 seconds is 0"

","To determine how long it took for Ingenuity to go from deployment to its first flight, we need to find the deployment date and the first flight date.

From the ""History"" section of the table, we can see that Ingenuity was deployed on ""3 April 2021"".

The first flight occurred on ""19 April 2021, 07:34 UTC"".

Since the deployment date is before the first flight date, we can calculate the time difference between these two dates to find the duration.

The first flight date is 16 days after the deployment date.

To convert this to months, we need to divide the number of days by the number of days in a month. However, since the exact number of days in a month can vary, we will use a simple approximation where we assume a month has approximately 30 days.

16 days ÷ 30 days/month ≈ 0.53 months

However, this is not the exact answer we want. We should use the actual number of days in a month for more accurate calculation. Since April has 30 days, we can calculate the exact time difference in months.

16 days ÷ 30 days ≈ 0.53 months

1.  Identify the start date of the tour. From the table, we see that the start date of the 12th Annual Honda Civic Tour was August 1, 2013.
2.  Identify the end date of the tour. From the table, we see that the end date of the 12th Annual Honda Civic Tour was October 6, 2013.
3.  Calculate the difference between the start and end dates to find the duration in days. October 6, 2013 - August 1, 2013 = 64 days.
4.  Convert the duration from days to months. Since there are approximately 30 days in a month, we can divide the total number of days by 30 to get an approximate duration in months. 64 days / 30 days/month ≈ 2.13 months.

However, since the tour started on August 1st, and ended on October 6th, it actually spanned across two months. Therefore, the tour lasted for 2 months.

","Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. We need to find out how long Argentina's Men's football team was ranked number one. 
2. We are given the information that the team was ranked number one for the following periods: 
   - March 2007 - June 2008 (approximately 16 months)
   - July-October 2015 (approximately 4 months)
   - April 2016 - April 2017 (approximately 12 months)
3. We need to find the longest period among these.

Comparing the lengths of the periods:
- 16 months (March 2007 - June 2008) is the longest period.
- 12 months (April 2016 - April 2017) is the second longest period.
- 4 months (July-October 2015) is the shortest period.

Therefore, the longest time Argentina's Men's football team was ranked number one is 16 months.

Flights	29
Flight time	55 minutes, 23 seconds
Travelled	7.17 km (4.46 mi) on Mars as of 11 June 2022 | [update]

","To find the answer, we need to determine the date of Ingenuity's first flight and its last flight, and then calculate the time difference between the two dates.

The first flight occurred on 19 April 2021. 
The last flight occurred on 11 June 2022.

We need to find the time difference in days between these two dates and then convert it into months.

Step 1: Find the time difference in days.
To do this, we'll subtract the earlier date from the later date.

11 June 2022 - 19 April 2021 = 1 year and approximately 1.83 months.

However, we need to convert this into a more precise time difference in days.

1 year = 365.25 days (accounting for leap years)
1.83 months ≈ 1.83 * 30.44 days ≈ 55.8 days

So, the total time difference is approximately 365.25 + 55.8 = 421.05 days.

Step 2: Convert the time difference in days to months.
There are approximately 30.44 days in a month.

421.05 days / 30.44 days per month ≈ 13.85 months

","To find the final answer, let's break down the information step by step.

1. First, we need to identify the start date of the Backwoods Barbie Tour and the Blue Smoke World Tour. However, the start date of the Backwoods Barbie Tour is not provided in the table. But we can find it in the Dolly Parton concert chronology section where the Backwoods Barbie Tour is mentioned before the Better Day World Tour.

2. The Dolly Parton concert chronology section mentions the Backwoods Barbie Tour as ""(2008)"" and the Blue Smoke World Tour as ""(2014)"".

3. Since the year of the Backwoods Barbie Tour is 2008 and the year of the Blue Smoke World Tour is 2014, we can calculate the difference in years between the two tours.

4. The difference between 2014 and 2008 is 6 years.

5. Therefore, the Blue Smoke World Tour began 6 years after the Backwoods Barbie Tour.

2. Identify the start year of the Gaza-Israel conflict: 
   We can see in the ""current war"" section that the Gaza-Israel conflict started on 28 June 2006.

3. Calculate the number of years after the start of the conflict that Sudan ceased to be a belligerent:

Since the appointment and installation dates are not necessarily the same as the start of his term, we need to determine which date is more relevant. In this case, the appointment date is likely more relevant because it is the date when he officially became the Bishop of Mostar-Duvno.

Now that we have the start and end dates, we can calculate the length of his term.

","To find out how long Black Dog Siding remained open, we need to determine the date it was opened and the date it was closed or renamed. 

Step 1: Identify the opening date of Black Dog Siding. 
From the ""Key dates"" section of the table, we see that Black Dog Siding was opened on 3 November 1863.

Step 2: Identify the date when Black Dog Siding was closed or renamed.

","To answer the question, we need to find the duration of Miloš Obrenović I's reign as Grand Vožd of Serbia, where Karađorđe was his predecessor.

Step 1: Identify the relevant information from the table. 
We see that Miloš Obrenović I was the Grand Vožd of Serbia from 23 April 1815 to 6 November 1817.

Step 1: Find the start date of the Mexican Empire. 
From the table, we see that the Mexican Empire began with the Plan of Iguala on 24 February 1821 and the Independence of Mexico on 28 September 1821. However, since both of these dates are for the start of the empire, we can consider the start date as 24 February 1821.

1. The ""Duration"" field in the ""Program history"" section tells us the total duration of the program in years, but it does not specify the start and end years.
2. We can find the start year from the ""First flight"" field, which mentions the flight ALT-12 on August 12, 1977.
3. We can find the end year from the ""Last flight"" field, which mentions the flight STS-135 on July 21, 2011.
4. To find the duration in years, we subtract the start year from the end year: 2011 - 1977 = 34 years.

However, since the question asks for the duration of the program, we need to consider the entire period from the first flight to the last flight, including the years when the program was active but not necessarily flying. The ""Duration"" field in the table directly gives us this information.

Final Answer: The final answer is 39 years."

","To determine how long in years AT&T had been known by a different name, let's break down the information provided in the table.

1. The table lists two names that AT&T was formerly known by: Southwestern Bell Corporation (1983-1995) and SBC Communications Inc. (1995-2005).

2. We need to find the total duration for which AT&T was known by these names. To do this, we'll calculate the time spent with each name and then add them together.

3. Southwestern Bell Corporation was the name from 1983 to 1995. The duration is 12 years (1995 - 1983).

4. SBC Communications Inc. was the name from 1995 to 2005. The duration is 10 years (2005 - 1995).

5. To find the total duration, we'll add the two durations together: 12 years + 10 years = 22 years.

Therefore, AT&T had been known by a different name for 22 years.

","Q: How long in years had the Salvadoran Civil War been going on when North Korea withdrew?

To answer this question, let's break it down into steps:

Step 1: Identify the date when North Korea withdrew its diplomatic support. The table mentions that North Korea withdrew its diplomatic support until 1990.

Step 2: Identify the duration of the Salvadoran Civil War. The table mentions that the war started on 15 October 1979 and ended on 16 January 1992.

Step 3: Calculate the total duration of the Salvadoran Civil War. From 15 October 1979 to 16 January 1992 is approximately 12 years and 3 months.

Step 4: Determine how long the war had been going on when North Korea withdrew its support. Since North Korea withdrew its support until 1990, we need to find out how long the war had been going on until that point.

Step 5: Since the war started on 15 October 1979 and North Korea withdrew its support until 1990, the war had been going on for approximately 10 years and 10 months when North Korea withdrew.

","To find the length of time AC/DC has been active in the music scene, we need to look at the ""Years active"" information in the table.

Step 1: Identify the start year of AC/DC's activity.
From the table, we see that AC/DC started in 1973.

Step 2: Identify the end year of AC/DC's activity.
The table mentions that AC/DC is still active as of the present year, which is not explicitly stated but we can assume it's the current year (2022) based on the context. However, it does not explicitly state that AC/DC will continue to be active in the future, so we will consider the end year to be 2022.

Step 3: Calculate the length of time AC/DC has been active.
To find the length of time AC/DC has been active, we need to subtract the start year from the end year. 
Length of time = End year - Start year
Length of time = 2022 - 1973
Length of time = 49 years

","To answer the question, we need to find the year when the current constitution of Belarus was formed and then calculate the time elapsed since then.

Step 1: Find the year when the current constitution was formed.
From the table, we see that the current constitution of Belarus was formed on 15 March 1994.

Step 2: Determine the current year.
Since the current date is December 2022, we can consider this as the current year.

Step 3: Calculate the time elapsed since the current constitution was formed.
Time elapsed = Current year - Year the current constitution was formed
Time elapsed = 2022 - 1994
Time elapsed = 28 years

Therefore, Belarus has been under its current Constitution for 28 years.

2. It also mentions that V/Line was formed as a statutory corporation on 1 October 2003. However, this does not mean it was not a corporation before that date, but rather it changed its status from a brand to a statutory corporation.

3. To find the total duration, we need to calculate the difference between the two dates. The difference between 1 October 2003 and 1 July 1983 is approximately 20 years.

However, we need to consider the fact that V/Line was already a corporation in 1983, but with a different status. The exact duration of V/Line as a corporation is not explicitly mentioned, but based on the given information, we can calculate the time period from 1983 to 2003.

","To find out how long Yale University has been in existence, we need to follow these steps:

1. Identify the date when Yale University was established. 
   In the table, we see that Yale University was established on ""October 9, 1701"".

2. Identify the current date. 
   We are given that the current date is December, 2022.

3. Calculate the difference between the current date and the date when Yale University was established.
   To do this, we need to find out how many years have passed since 1701.

4. Since the current year is 2022, we subtract 1701 from 2022 to get the number of years.
   2022 - 1701 = 321

However, we need to consider that the year of establishment is also a year in the count. Therefore, we need to add 1 to the result to get the correct number of years.

5. Add 1 to 321 to get the final answer.
   321 + 1 = 322

","To determine the total years the church has been open, we need to find the time period when it was active and subtract the time period when it was closed.

1.  The church was founded in the 13th century. However, this information alone is not enough to determine the exact time it was first active. We'll need more information.
2.  The church was completed in 1707 and was active until 1873. This gives us an initial time period of 166 years (1707 - 1873).
3.  However, the church was not active from 1873 to 1949. To find the total years the church has been open, we need to subtract this time period from the initial time period.
4.  The church was consecrated in 1949, which means it was active again from 1949 onwards. This means the church has been active for 73 years (2022 - 1949).
5.  To find the total years the church has been open, we subtract the time it was closed (1873-1949) from the total time it was active (1707-1873 and 1949-2022).

","To find the length of Mišić's bishop term, we need to determine the start and end dates of his term.

Step 1: Find the start date of Mišić's bishop term. 
The table shows that Mišić was appointed on 29 April 1912. However, this is the date of his appointment, not the start of his term. The Installed date is usually when the person begins their term. Therefore, the start date of Mišić's bishop term is 14 July 1912.

Step 2: Find the end date of Mišić's bishop term. 
The table shows that Mišić's term ended on 26 March 1942.

Step 3: Calculate the length of Mišić's bishop term.
To find the length of the term, we subtract the start date from the end date. 
End date: 26 March 1942
Start date: 14 July 1912

First, we need to convert the dates into a format that can be easily subtracted. We can convert the dates to a common year, 1942, for the end date and 1912 for the start date.

End date (1942): 26 March 1942

3. The second marriage to Sarah Herritage occurred in 1758. However, the table does not provide information on the duration of this marriage. Therefore, we can only determine the duration of the first marriage.

Since we are looking for the total duration of both marriages, we will add the duration of the first marriage (5 years) to the duration of the second marriage, which is unknown.

","To answer the question, we need to determine the completion year and the year it was closed. 

1. The completion year of Valen Chapel is given as 1707.
2. It was closed from 1873 to 1949. To find the duration of its operation after completion, we need to subtract the completion year from the closure year. However, since it was closed in 1873, we should find out how long it was operational before it was closed.

First, let's find out how long it was operational before it was closed. 
- Closure year: 1873
- Completion year: 1707
- Duration before closure: 1873 - 1707 = 166 years

However, the question asks for the duration after completion. To find this, we need to subtract the completion year from the consecration year, since it was consecrated in 1949, which indicates it was operational after its completion. 

- Consecration year: 1949
- Completion year: 1707
- Duration after completion: 1949 - 1707 = 242 years

However, the consecration year is not the same as the year it was operational. It was consecrated in 1949 but"

","To find the answer, let's break down the information given in the table.

1. The first time Brandon Miller won the Harry Lumley Trophy is mentioned as 2002.
2. The last time Brandon Miller won the Harry Lumley Trophy is mentioned as 2014.

Now, we need to find the difference between these two years to determine how long it was between the first and the last time Brandon Miller won the Harry Lumley Trophy.

To find the difference, we'll subtract the earlier year (2002) from the later year (2014).

2014 - 2002 = 12

So, it was 12 years between the first and the last time Brandon Miller won the Harry Lumley Trophy.

2. Determine the date of the event: The event took place on 9 August 2016.

3. Calculate the date one year before the event: To find the date one year before, we subtract one year from the year of the event. So, one year before 2016 is 2015.

4. Since we are looking for complete months, we need to find the date one year before the event, which is 9 August 2015.

5. Count the number of complete months from the start of the year to the date of the event: August 9th is the 211th day of the year.

1. Identify the date Jeffrey Epstein was apprehended.
2. Identify the date his final mugshot was taken.
3. Calculate the number of days between these two dates.

From the table, we can see that Jeffrey Epstein was apprehended on July 6, 2019, and his final mugshot was taken on July 9, 2019.

Now, let's calculate the number of days between these two dates. Since both dates are in the same month (July 2019), we can simply subtract the day of apprehension from the day of the final mugshot:

July 9, 2019 - July 6, 2019 = 3 days

Therefore, Jeffrey Epstein's final mugshot was taken 3 days after his apprehension.

Final Answer: The final answer is 3."

","To determine the number of days between the laying down and launching of INS Trishul, we need to follow these steps:

1. Find the date when INS Trishul was laid down: 24 September 1999
2. Find the date when INS Trishul was launched: 24 November 2000
3. Calculate the difference between the two dates in days.

To calculate the difference, we can use the formula: 

Number of days = (Launch Date - Laying Down Date)

First, we need to convert both dates into a format that can be easily compared. Since the dates are in the format ""day month year,"" we can use the following calculation:

For the laying down date: 24 September 1999
- 1999 is the year
- 9 is the month (September is the 9th month)
- 24 is the day

For the launch date: 24 November 2000
- 2000 is the year
- 11 is the month (November is the 11th month)
- 24 is the day

Now, we can calculate the difference:

Launch Date: 24 November 2000
Laying Down Date: 24 September 1999

","To find the number of days between the first flight and the introduction of the X-15, we need to calculate the difference in days between these two dates.

1. The first flight of the X-15 was on June 8, 1959.
2. The X-15 was introduced on September 17, 1959.
3. To find the difference in days, we need to subtract the date of the first flight from the date of introduction. Since both dates are in the same year (1959), we can directly calculate the difference in days.
4. From June 8 to September 17, there are approximately 3 months and 9 days.
5. There are 30 days in June and 31 days in July, so from June 8 to July 31, there are 23 days.
6. August has 31 days, so from July 31 to August 31, there are 31 days.
7. September has 30 days, so from August 31 to September 17, there are 17 days.
8. Adding these up, we get 23 + 31 + 17 = 71 days from June 8 to September 17.

- The difference in days is 5 - 8 = -3 days.

Now, let's convert the difference in months to days: 
- 1 year has 365 days (ignoring leap years for simplicity).

","To find out how many days after the formation of the Belarusian People's Republic Belarus gained independence from Russia, we need to follow these steps:

1. First, let's identify the date of formation of the Belarusian People's Republic. According to the table, it was formed on 9 March 1918.

2. Next, we need to identify the date when Belarus gained independence from Russia. According to the table, it gained independence from Russia on 25 March 1918.

3. Now, we need to find the difference between these two dates to determine how many days passed between the formation of the Belarusian People's Republic and its independence from Russia.

Since both dates are in the same month (March), we can simply subtract the day of the formation (9) from the day of independence (25). 

25 - 9 = 16

Now, let's calculate the difference in days between August 10, 2019, and July 6, 2019.

August has 31 days. So, from July 6 to July 31, there are 25 days.
August 1 to August 10, there are 10 days.
Therefore, the total number of days between July 6, 2019, and August 10, 2019, is 25 + 10 = 35 days.

","To find the number of days between the launch date and the landing date of Chandrayaan-2, we need to follow these steps:

1. Identify the launch date: The launch date of Chandrayaan-2 is given as July 22, 2019.

2. Identify the landing date: The landing date of Chandrayaan-2 is given as September 6, 2019.

3. Calculate the difference between the two dates: To find the number of days between the launch date and the landing date, we need to subtract the launch date from the landing date.

4. Perform the calculation:
   - Launch date: July 22, 2019
   - Landing date: September 6, 2019

   Since September 6 is after July 22, we can directly calculate the number of days in the month of August (31 days) and the days in September up to the 6th (6 days).

   August has 31 days, so there are 31 days in August.
   In September, there are 6 days up to the 6th.

   Total days = 31 (August) + 6 (September up to 6th) = 37 days

","To find the total number of days the 14 On Fire tour was shown in 2014, we need to calculate the total number of days the tour lasted and then subtract the number of days it was shown in other years.

1. The tour started on 21 February 2014 and ended on 22 November 2014. 
2. We need to calculate the difference between these two dates to find the total number of days the tour was shown in 2014.

","To determine the number of days Mohammad Yamin was Minister of Law, we need to find the start and end dates of his term as the Minister of Law.

From the table, we can see that Mohammad Yamin served as the 6th Minister of Law from:
27 April 1951 to 3 April 1952

Now, let's break down the dates into start and end dates:
- Start date: 27 April 1951
- End date: 3 April 1952

To find the number of days, we need to subtract the start date from the end date. However, since the start date is in April and the end date is in April, we need to calculate the days in April for both years.

April 1951: 27 days
April 1952: 3 days

Now, let's calculate the total number of days:
27 (days in April 1951) + 3 (days in April 1952) = 30 days

However, this calculation does not account for the days in March 1952. Since Mohammad Yamin served until 3 April 1952, we need to include the remaining days in March 1952.

","To find the number of days the 12th Annual Honda Civic Tour was held, we need to determine the difference between the end date and the start date.

Step 1: Identify the start and end dates of the tour.

Step 2: Convert the dates to a common format for easier calculation.
Both dates are already in a format that can be easily converted to days. We can ignore the year for now since it's not necessary for the calculation.

Step 3: Calculate the difference between the end date and the start date.
To find the number of days, we can count the days from August 1 to October 6.

August has 31 days, so from August 1 to August 31, there are 31 days.
September has 30 days, so from September 1 to September 30, there are 30 days.
October has 6 days from October 1 to October 6.

Step 4: Add the number of days in each month to get the total number of days.

","To find the number of full months the 14 On Fire concert tour spanned, we need to determine the start and end dates of the tour and count the months between them.

Step 1: Identify the start and end dates of the tour.
- The start date of the tour is 21 February 2014.
- The end date of the tour is 22 November 2014.

Step 2: Count the months between the start and end dates.

- There are 9 months between February and November.

However, since the tour started in February, we need to consider it as a full month.

Step 3: Determine the total number of full months.
- We already counted 9 months, but we need to include February as a full month.
- Therefore, the total number of full months is 9 (from March to November) + 1 (February) = 10 months.

","To find the answer, we need to determine the order date and the commission date of INS Trishul, then calculate the time difference between the two dates.

From the table, we can find the order date and the commission date:

- Order date: 17 November 1997

Now, we need to find the difference between these two dates. 

To calculate the time difference, we can break it down into years and months:

","A: Let’s think step by step.

1. The New York City premiere of 49th Parallel was on 5 March 1942.
2. We need to find the release date for the rest of the country in the United Kingdom, which was 24 November 1941.
3. To find the number of months between these two dates, we need to find the difference in months between 5 March 1942 and 24 November 1941.
4. Since the year is the same, we only need to find the difference in months between the two dates.
5. From 5 March 1942 to 24 November 1941, we subtract 3 months from 24 November 1941, since 5 March 1942 is 3 months after 24 November 1941. 
6. Therefore, the number of months after the New York City premiere that 49th Parallel was released to the rest of the country is 3.

Final Answer: The final answer is 3."

","To find the answer, we need to determine the release dates of the UK and US nationwide releases and then calculate the time difference between them.

From the table, we can see that the UK nationwide release date is 24 November 1941, and the US nationwide release date is 5 March 1942.

Now, let's break down the release dates into months and days:

UK release date: 24 November 1941
- November 1941 is the 11th month of the year.
- 24 November 1941 is the 24th day of the month.

US release date: 5 March 1942
- March 1942 is the 3rd month of the year.
- 5 March 1942 is the 5th day of the month.

Since March is the 3rd month of the year, we can subtract 2 from November to get the month difference: 11 (November) - 2 = 9. However, we also need to account for the fact that we are counting the months from the release date in the UK to the release date in the US.

","To determine the number of months between the first crewed flight and the last flight, we need to follow these steps:

1. First, we need to find the date of the first crewed flight and the last flight in a comparable format. The first crewed flight occurred on April 12, 1981, and the last flight occurred on July 21, 2011.

2. Since the dates are in different years, we'll convert them to a comparable format, which is a numerical representation of the date (year-month-day). The first crewed flight date in this format is 1981-04-12, and the last flight date is 2011-07-21.

3. Now, we need to find the difference between the two dates. To do this, we'll find the difference in years, months, and days.

   The difference in years is 2011 - 1981 = 30 years.
   The difference in months can be found by subtracting the month of the first flight (April, which is the 4th month) from the month of the last flight (July, which is the 7th month). This gives us 7 - 4 = 3 months, but since we have "

","To answer the question, we need to determine the date when the death toll was 47 police officers and 7 soldiers, and then calculate the number of months that have passed since the start of the protests.

1. The death toll of 47 police officers and 7 soldiers was reported by the State Administration Council (SAC) as of 23 May 2021.
2. The protests started on 2 February 2021.
3. To find the number of months that have passed since the start of the protests, we need to calculate the difference between the date of the reported death toll (23 May 2021) and the start date of the protests (2 February 2021).

From 2 February 2021 to 23 May 2021, we can calculate the number of months as follows:

- February 2021 has 28 days, and from 2 February to 23 February, there are 21 days. This is approximately 0.7 months (21 days / 30 days ≈ 0.7).
- March 2021 has 31 days, so from 23 February to 31 March, there are 38 days. This is approximately 1.3 months (38 days / 30 days ≈"

Casualties and losses
['1,279 killed | 3,761 killed', 'Civilian casualties: See the Aftermath section']

","To find the answer, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the start date of the war.
2. Determine the date when the Croatian Army was formed.
3. Calculate the difference between the two dates to find the number of months.

From the table, we can see that the war started on 20 September 1991. 

The date when the Croatian Army was formed is mentioned in the ""Units involved"" section: ""(from November 1991)"".

So, the Croatian Army was formed in November 1991.

Now, let's calculate the difference between the start date (20 September 1991) and the formation date (November 1991). 

Since November is the 11th month of the year, and the war started on 20 September, we can count the number of months:

September 1991 (1 month)
October 1991 (2 months)
November 1991 (3 months)

Therefore, the Croatian Army was formed 3 months after the war started.

","To find out how many months ago the earliest detainees of the Myanmar Spring Revolution could have been detained, we need to follow these steps:

1. Identify the start date of the Myanmar Spring Revolution: The start date of the Myanmar Spring Revolution is given as 2 February 2021.

2. Identify the number of months since the start date: To find the number of months since the start date, we need to calculate the difference between the current date (December 2022) and the start date (February 2021).

3. Calculate the difference in months: Since the start date is in February 2021 and the current date is December 2022, we can calculate the difference in months by finding the difference between the years and multiplying it by 12 (since there are 12 months in a year), then adding the difference in months between the current year and the start year.

   - Difference in years: 2022 - 2021 = 1 year
   - Difference in months: Since we are in December 2022, we need to subtract 2 months from 12 to account for the current year: 12 - 2 = 10 months

2. Identify the current date.
   Since the current date is given as December 2022, we will use this as our current date.

3. Calculate the difference between the current date and the date of the last ODI.
   Since we are given the month and year of the last ODI, and the current date is also in December 2022, we can directly calculate the difference in months.

4. Subtract the month of the last ODI from the current month to find the difference in months.
   The last ODI was played in June 2022, and the current date is in December 2022. So, the difference in months is December - June = 6 months.

Therefore, Australia played their last ODI 6 months ago.

","To find out how many months ago Max Aaron retired, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the date of Max Aaron's retirement: 
   - The text mentions that Max Aaron retired on April 19, 2018.

2. Calculate the current year and month: 
   - Since the current year is 2022 (given in the prompt), we are looking for the difference in months between April 2022 and April 2018.

3. Subtract the retirement month and year from the current month and year to find the difference in months.

Since the current year is 2022 and we are in the month of December, we need to calculate the difference between April 2018 and December 2022.

April 2018 to December 2022 is 4 years and 8 months.

4. Convert the years to months: 
   - 4 years = 4 * 12 = 48 months

5. Add the months: 
   - 48 months (from years) + 8 months (from the remaining time) = 56 months

Therefore, Max Aaron retired 56 months ago.

Step 3: The current year is 2022, and the election year is 2018, so we have a 4-year difference.
Step 4: Since we are in December 2022, we need to subtract the election year from the current year to get the total number of years.
Step 5: To find the total number of months, we multiply the total number of years by 12 (since there are 12 months in a year) and then subtract the months that have already passed in the current year.
Step 6: December has 1 month left, so we subtract 1 from the total number of months.
Step 7: Now, we calculate the total number of months: (4 years * 12 months/year) - 12 months = 48 months - 12 months = 36 months.

","To determine the number of months left in the Mars Express mission duration, we need to first calculate the total duration of the mission in months.

1. The mission duration is given as 19 years and 1 month since launch. We need to convert this to months. 
   1 year = 12 months
   So, 19 years = 19 * 12 = 228 months
   Adding the 1 month, the total duration is 228 + 1 = 229 months

2. The mission has been ongoing for 18 years, 6 months and 7 days at Mars. We need to convert this to months. 
   18 years = 18 * 12 = 216 months
   Adding the 6 months, the total duration is 216 + 6 = 222 months
   The remaining duration is 229 - 222 = 7 months

3. Since the question asks for the number of months left in the mission duration, we need to subtract the remaining duration from the total duration.
   Total duration = 229 months
   Remaining duration = 222 months
   Months left in the mission duration = 229 - 222 = 7 months

","To answer the question, we need to find the release dates of ""Price to Play"" and ""How About You"" and then calculate the difference in months.

From the table, we can see that:
- ""Price to Play"" was released on April 1, 2003.
- ""How About You"" was released on December 23, 2003.

Now, let's calculate the difference in months:

1. Find the common year for both release dates, which is 2003.
2. Since both songs were released in the same year, we can directly calculate the difference in months.
3. ""How About You"" was released on December 23, 2003, and ""Price to Play"" was released on April 1, 2003. This means that ""How About You"" was released 8 months after ""Price to Play"".

However, the question asks for the difference in months before ""Price to Play"" was released, which is not a valid question. The correct interpretation of the question is the difference in months between the release dates of ""Price to Play"" and ""How About You"".

From the ""Belligerents"" section of the table, we can see that Libya supported the EPRDF from 1977 to 1985, which is a total of 8 years.

Next, we need to find out how long Libya supported the Derg. The table states that Libya supported the Derg from 1977 to 1991. However, we need to find out the exact year when Libya stopped supporting the Derg. Since we know that Libya stopped supporting the EPRDF in 1985, and Libya's support for the EPRDF started in 1977, it is likely that Libya's support for the Derg ended in 1985 as well.

So, Libya supported the Derg from 1977 to 1985, which is a total of 8 years.

","To answer the question, we need to determine the number of years Owen played for each team. 

1. First, let's identify the years Owen played for Liverpool: 
   - He started playing for Liverpool in 1991 and left in 2004. 
   So, the duration is 2004 - 1991 = 13 years.

2. Next, let's identify the years Owen played for Newcastle United: 
   - He started playing for Newcastle United in 2005 and left in 2009. 
   So, the duration is 2009 - 2005 = 4 years.

3. Now, let's calculate the difference in the number of years Owen played for each team: 
   13 (years with Liverpool) - 4 (years with Newcastle United) = 9 years.

Therefore, Owen played 9 more years for Liverpool than Newcastle United.

","To find the total years Benny McCoy played for MLB, we need to find the difference between his last MLB appearance and his MLB debut.

Q: What is the date of Benny McCoy's MLB debut?
A: The date of Benny McCoy's MLB debut is September 14, 1938.

Q: What is the date of Benny McCoy's last MLB appearance?
A: The date of Benny McCoy's last MLB appearance is September 28, 1941.

Q: How many years are between September 28, 1941, and September 14, 1938?
A: To find the difference, we can subtract the year of the debut from the year of the last appearance: 1941 - 1938 = 3 years.

However, we also need to consider the months. Since the debut was in September and the last appearance was also in September, we need to add one more year to account for the full year that passed.

","To find the total years Roy Emerson played as both an amateur and a professional, we need to break down the information provided in the table.

1. The table mentions that Roy Emerson turned pro in 1968. This is the starting point for his professional career.

2. To find the duration of his amateur career, we need to subtract his turning pro year from the year he started his amateur tour, which was 1953. 
   Amateur career duration = 1968 - 1953 = 15 years

3. Now, we need to find the year he retired. According to the table, Roy Emerson retired in 1983.

4. To find the total duration of his professional career, we subtract the year he turned pro from the year he retired:
   Professional career duration = 1983 - 1968 = 15 years

5. However, the question asks for the total years played as both an amateur and a professional. Since we've already calculated the duration of his amateur career (15 years), we need to add this to the duration of his professional career:
   Total years played = Amateur career duration + Professional career duration = 15 + 15 = 30 years

- He became the Bishop of Mostar-Duvno and Apostolic Administrator of Trebinje-Mrkan on 29 April 1912 (under the ""category: christian leader"" section).

Now, let's calculate the difference:

29 April 1912 (became bishop) - 7 July 1882 (ordained) = 29 years, 9 months

However, since the question asks for years, we'll consider the years only. 

29 years, 9 months ≈ 29 years (for the purpose of this calculation)

Therefore, Alojzije Mišić became the Bishop of Mostar-Duvno and Apostolic Administrator of Trebinje-Mrkan approximately "

2. Find the year when Mekelle became the capital of the Ethiopian Empire.
3. Subtract the year of establishment from the year Mekelle became the capital to find the number of years.

From the table, we can see that the Ethiopian Empire was first established in 1270.

To find the year when Mekelle became the capital, we need to look for the information in the ""Capital"" column. According to the table, Mekelle was the capital from 1871-1889.

Now, we need to subtract the year of establishment (1270) from the year Mekelle became the capital (1871).

So, Mekelle became the capital 601 years after the Ethiopian Empire was first established.

","To find out how many years after Gorshkova began skating did she win her first medal, we need to follow these steps:

1. Identify the year Kristina Gorshkova began skating.
2. Identify the year she won her first medal.
3. Calculate the difference between the two years.

From the table, we can see that Kristina Gorshkova began skating in 1993.

Her first medal was won at the 2007-08 Junior Grand Prix Final, which was a Bronze medal. However, since the Junior Grand Prix Final in 2007-08 was a season medal, we need to look for her first medal in a single year. Looking at the table, her first medal in a single year was the Bronze medal at the 2008 World Junior Championships.

The year she won her first medal is 2008.

Now, let's calculate the difference between the year she began skating (1993) and the year she won her first medal (2008).

2008 - 1993 = 15 years

","To find the answer to the question, we need to determine the duration between the end of Miloš Obrenović's reign as Grand Vožd of Serbia and the start of his second reign as Prince of Serbia.

Step 1: Identify the end date of Miloš Obrenović's reign as Grand Vožd of Serbia.
The end date of his reign as Grand Vožd of Serbia is 6 November 1817.

Step 2: Identify the start date of Miloš Obrenović's second reign as Prince of Serbia.
The start date of his second reign as Prince of Serbia is 25 June 1839.

Step 3: Calculate the duration between the two dates.
To find the duration, we need to subtract the start date from the end date.
Duration = End date - Start date
Duration = 6 November 1817 - 25 June 1839

Step 4: Convert the dates to a common unit of time, such as years, to calculate the duration.
Since both dates are in the same year (1817 and 1839), we can directly subtract the years.
Duration = 1839 - 1817
Duration = 22 years

","To find the answer, we need to follow these steps:

1. Find the founding year of the NYSE: The table mentions that the NYSE was founded on May 17, 1792. This is the year we will use to calculate the time elapsed.

2. Find the year when the NYSE's market cap reached $26.2 trillion: The table states that the market cap reached this value in the year 2021.

3. Calculate the time elapsed: Subtract the founding year from the year when the market cap reached $26.2 trillion to find the number of years that have passed.

Now, let's perform the calculation:

Founding year: 1792
Year market cap reached $26.2 trillion: 2021

Time elapsed = 2021 - 1792 = 229 years

However, the question asks for the number of years after the NYSE's founding, so we need to consider the fact that the market cap reached $26.2 trillion in the year 2021, which is 229 years after the founding.

But, the year 2021 is the year after the market cap reached $26.2 trillion, so we need to subtract 1 from the total years to get the correct answer"

","To answer the question, we need to follow the steps below:

1. Identify the year when NYSE's volume was US$20.161 trillion.
2. Identify the year when NYSE was founded.
3. Calculate the difference between the two years to find the number of years after NYSE's founding when its volume was US$20.161 trillion.

From the table, we can see that:

- NYSE's volume was US$20.161 trillion in the year 2011 (step 1).
- NYSE was founded in the year 1792 (step 2).

Now, let's calculate the difference between the two years (step 3):

2011 - 1792 = 219 years

However, the question asks for the number of years after NYSE's founding when its volume was US$20.161 trillion. Since 2011 is after 1792, we need to subtract the result from 219 by 1.

219 - 1 = 218 years

However, the answer we have calculated is incorrect because the question asks how many years after NYSE's founding was its volume US$20.161 trillion, and the volume was in 2011 which is 219 years after NYSE's founding."

","To find the answer, let's break it down into steps.

Step 1: Identify the year of the PBY Catalina's first flight.
The first flight of the PBY Catalina was on 21 March 1935.

Step 2: Identify the year of the PBY Catalina's retirement by the United States Navy Reserve.
The PBY Catalina was retired by the United States Navy Reserve in January 1957.

Step 3: Calculate the number of years between the first flight and the retirement.
To find the number of years, we subtract the year of the first flight from the year of retirement.
1957 - 1935 = 22

However, since the question asks for the years after the first flight, we need to consider the time frame from the first flight to the retirement. Since the first flight occurred before the retirement, the correct calculation is:
1957 - 1935 = 22 years

However, the correct answer is 22 years, but since the retirement was in January 1957, and the first flight was in March 1935, the retirement was 22 years and 10 months after the first flight, but the question asks for the number of years after the first flight, which is 22"

","To answer the question, we need to find the years when Walter von Brauchitsch and Franklin D. Roosevelt were leaders, and then determine the difference between their start years.

Step 1: Find Walter von Brauchitsch's start year.
From the ""Commanders and leaders"" table, we can see that Walter von Brauchitsch was a leader from 1939-1940.

Step 2: Find Franklin D. Roosevelt's start year.
From the ""Commanders and leaders"" table, we can see that Franklin D. Roosevelt was a leader from 1944-1945.

Step 3: Calculate the difference between their start years.
Walter von Brauchitsch started in 1939 and Franklin D. Roosevelt started in 1944. To find the difference, we subtract 1939 from 1944, which gives us 5 years.

However, since the question asks for the years after Walter von Brauchitsch became a leader, we need to subtract his start year from Franklin D. Roosevelt's start year. 

So, 1944 - 1939 = 5 years.

Therefore, the answer is 5 years.

Final Answer: The final answer is 5."

","To find the answer to the question, we need to follow these steps:

1. Identify the year Worthy's NBA career began.
2. Identify the year Worthy won his first NBA championship.
3. Calculate the difference between the two years.

From the table, we can see that Worthy's NBA career began in 1982. 

To find the year Worthy won his first NBA championship, we need to look at the ""Career highlights and awards"" section of the table. It mentions that Worthy won 3 NBA championships, and the years of those championships are listed as 1985, 1987, and 1988. Since 1985 is the earliest year mentioned, it is the year Worthy won his first NBA championship.

Now, let's calculate the difference between the year Worthy's NBA career began (1982) and the year he won his first NBA championship (1985). 

1985 - 1982 = 3

Therefore, Worthy won his first NBA championship 3 years after his NBA career began.

","To answer the question, let's analyze the table step by step.

Step 1: Find the year when Australia achieved its best test ranking.
From the table, we can see that Australia achieved its best test ranking on 1 January 1952. 

Step 2: Find the year when Australia achieved its best ODI ranking.
From the table, we can see that Australia achieved its best ODI ranking on 1 January 1990.

Step 3: Calculate the difference between the two years.
To find the number of years between the two dates, we subtract the earlier date from the later date.

1990 - 1952 = 38

However, since the question asks for the number of years after achieving its best test ranking, we should calculate the difference from the year after 1952 (when the best test ranking was achieved) until 1990.

Step 4: Calculate the correct difference.
Since the best test ranking was achieved in 1952, we need to calculate the difference from 1953 until 1990.

1990 - 1953 = 37

Therefore, the correct answer is 37 years after achieving its best test ranking did Australia achieve its best ODI ranking.

2. Identify the year Mohammad-Ali Foroughi became Minister of Foreign Affairs.
3. Calculate the difference between the two years.

From the table, we can see that Mohammad-Ali Foroughi became a Member of the Parliament of Iran in 1909.

Now, let's find the year he became Minister of Foreign Affairs. According to the table, he became Minister of Foreign Affairs in two different periods:
- First period: 14 February 1923 - 15 June 1923
- Second period: 28 October 1923 - 1 September 1924

Since the question asks for the number of years after becoming a Member of the Parliament of Iran, we need to find the earliest period he became Minister of Foreign Affairs after becoming a Member of the Parliament. The first period is 14 February 1923 - 15 June 1923, which is after 1909.

Now, let's calculate the difference between 1923 and 1909:

","To answer this question, we need to follow these steps:

1. Find out when Alessandro Riguccini became active in the field.
2. Find out when Alessandro Riguccini joined Zanfer Promotions.

From the table, we can see that Alessandro Riguccini has been active since 1999. 

Now, let's find out when he joined Zanfer Promotions. According to the table, he joined Zanfer Promotions in 2012.

Now, let's calculate the difference between these two years: 
2012 - 1999 = 13

However, the question asks for how many years after becoming active did Riguccini join Zanfer Promotions. Since he joined Zanfer Promotions in 2012, we need to find the difference between 2012 and the year he became active (1999), but we also need to consider the year of the latest information update which is 2022.

However, since we know he started in 1999 and the question asks for years after becoming active, we can simply look at the year he joined Zanfer Promotions and the year he started and calculate the difference.

Final Answer: The final answer is 13."

","To answer the question, let's break it down step by step.

1. First, we need to determine the year Watanjar began his military service. According to the table, he served in the military from 1967 to 1992. Therefore, he began his military service in 1967.

2. Next, we need to find the year Watanjar first took office as Minister of Communications. Looking at the table, we see that he first took office as Minister of Communications in 1978, but we need to identify which of the two periods of service is the first one. We can see that the first period of service (30 April 1978 - July 1978) is the first time he took office as Minister of Communications.

3. Now, we need to calculate the number of years between the beginning of Watanjar's military service (1967) and his first time taking office as Minister of Communications (1978). To do this, we subtract the starting year of his military service from the starting year of his first term as Minister of Communications: 1978 - 1967 = 11.

4. Therefore, Watanjar first took office as Minister of Communications 11 years after beginning his military service.

","To find the number of years after Young's final MLB appearance that he died, we need to follow these steps:

1. Identify Young's final MLB appearance date: This can be found in the ""Last MLB appearance"" section of the table, which is October 2, 1948.

2. Identify Young's death date: This can be found in the ""Died"" section of the table, which is December 25, 1983.

3. Calculate the difference between the death date and the final MLB appearance date: Since both dates are in the format of year-month-day, we can directly subtract the years, months, and days.

   Death date: 1983-12-25
   Final MLB appearance date: 1948-10-02

   Years difference: 1983 - 1948 = 35 years
   Months difference: 12 - 10 = 2 months
   Days difference: 25 - 2 = 23 days

4. Since we are interested in the number of years, we can ignore the months and days difference and only consider the years difference.

Therefore, Young died 35 years after his final MLB appearance.

","To find out how many years after his first penalty Jeffrey Epstein was apprehended, we need to follow these steps:

1. First, we need to find out when Jeffrey Epstein received his first penalty. The table mentions that he received a penalty of 13 months with work release in 2008.

2. Next, we need to calculate the date when this penalty was completed. Since the penalty was for 13 months, and assuming he was given the work release immediately, we can estimate the completion date as around January 2009 (13 months after January 2008).

3. Now, we need to find out when Jeffrey Epstein was apprehended for the second time. According to the table, he was apprehended on July 6, 2019.

4. Finally, we need to calculate the difference between the date of apprehension (July 6, 2019) and the estimated completion date of his first penalty (January 2009). 

To calculate the difference, we can subtract the estimated completion date from the date of apprehension. However, since we're calculating years, we can simplify this by considering the difference in years and months between these two dates.

The difference between January 2009 and July 2019 is approximately 10 years"

","To find the answer, we need to follow these steps:

1. Identify the completion year of Valen Chapel: The completion year of Valen Chapel is given in the ""Architecture"" section of the table. It is stated as 1707.

2. Identify the consecration year of Valen Chapel: The consecration year of Valen Chapel is given in the ""History"" section of the table. It is stated as 31 July 1949.

","Q: How many years after last playing for Real Madrid did Zidane become its assistant manager?

A: Let's think step by step.

1. First, we need to find the year when Zidane last played for Real Madrid. From the ""Senior career"" section, we can see that he played for Real Madrid from 2001 to 2006. Therefore, the last year he played for Real Madrid was 2006.

2. Next, we need to find the year when Zidane became the assistant manager of Real Madrid. From the ""Teams managed"" section, we can see that he was the assistant manager of Real Madrid from 2013 to 2014.

3. Now, we need to calculate the number of years between 2006 and 2013. To do this, we subtract 2006 from 2013, which gives us 7 years.

Therefore, Zidane became the assistant manager of Real Madrid 7 years after he last played for the team.

","To find the number of years after marrying his spouse that Johann Friedrich Wilhelm Adolf Baeyer won the Liebig Medal, we need to follow these steps:

1. Find the year Adolf Baeyer married his spouse, Adelheid Bendemann.
2. Find the year Adolf Baeyer won the Liebig Medal.
3. Subtract the year of marriage from the year of winning the Liebig Medal to find the number of years.

From the table, we can see that Adolf Baeyer married Adelheid Bendemann in 1868.

Now, let's find the year Adolf Baeyer won the Liebig Medal. According to the table, he won the Liebig Medal in 1903.

Finally, let's subtract the year of marriage from the year of winning the Liebig Medal:

1903 (year of winning the Liebig Medal) - 1868 (year of marriage) = 35

However, since the question asks for the years after marrying his spouse, we should consider the time after the marriage. Therefore, the correct calculation should be:

","To find the answer, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the opening year of the stadium: The opening year of the stadium is mentioned in the table as ""12 September 1926"". Since we are not considering the exact date, we can consider it as 1926.

2. Determine the renovation year of the stadium: The renovation year of the stadium is mentioned in the table as ""5 December 2009"".

3. Calculate the number of years between the opening and renovation: To find the number of years between the opening and renovation, we subtract the opening year from the renovation year: 2009 - 1926 = 83.

However, this is the number of years from the opening to the renovation in the year 2009, not the number of years after the opening. To find the number of years after the opening, we need to consider the year 1926 as the reference point. The renovation occurred in 2009, which is 83 years after the opening in 1926.

","To find the number of years after the stadium's opening that it was renovated, we need to determine the opening and renovation dates.

1. The opening date of the stadium is given as 12 September 1926.
2. The renovation date of the stadium is given as 5 December 2009.

Now, we need to calculate the difference between these two dates.

To do this, we'll first calculate the number of years between the opening and renovation dates.

Opening year: 1926
Renovation year: 2009

Difference in years = Renovation year - Opening year
= 2009 - 1926
= 83 years

However, this is the total number of years between the opening and renovation dates. To find the number of years after the stadium's opening that it was renovated, we need to subtract 1 from this total.

Number of years after opening = Difference in years - 1
= 83 - 1
= 82 years

","To find the answer, we need to follow these steps:

1. Find the year Leo Diegel turned professional.
   In the table, under the ""Career"" section, we see that Leo Diegel turned professional in 1916.

2. Find the year Leo Diegel married Violet Bird Diegel.
   In the table, under the ""Personal information"" section, we see that Leo Diegel married Violet Bird Diegel in 1934.

3. Calculate the difference between the year of marriage and the year of turning professional.

","To answer this question, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the start date of the terrorism in Egypt.
2. Find the date when Wilayat Sinai became a belligerent.
3. Calculate the difference between the two dates to find the number of years.

Step 1: Determine the start date of the terrorism in Egypt.
The start date of the terrorism in Egypt is given as 3 July 2013.

Step 2: Find the date when Wilayat Sinai became a belligerent.
According to the table, Wilayat Sinai became a belligerent in 2014.

Step 3: Calculate the difference between the two dates to find the number of years.
To find the number of years, we subtract the start year from the year when Wilayat Sinai became a belligerent.

2014 (year Wilayat Sinai became a belligerent) - 2013 (start year) = 1 year

However, since the exact date is not provided, we should also consider the month and day difference.

3 July 2013 to 1 year later would be 3 July 2014, so the difference is 1 year.

","To determine the number of years after the beginning of the dissolution of the Soviet Union that Chechnya became an unrecognized breakaway state, we need to follow these steps:

1. Identify the start date of the dissolution of the Soviet Union. From the table, we see that the dissolution began on ""16 November 1988"".
2. Identify the date when Chechnya became an unrecognized breakaway state. From the table, we see that Chechnya became an unrecognized breakaway state in ""1991-2000"".
3. Calculate the number of years between the start date and the date when Chechnya became an unrecognized breakaway state.

Now, let's do the calculation:

Start date: 16 November 1988
End date: 1991 (since Chechnya became an unrecognized breakaway state in 1991, not in the year 2000)

To find the number of years, we can subtract the start year from the end year: 1991 - 1988 = 3 years

However, since the end date is in 1991 and the start date is in 1988, we need to consider the full duration from 1988 to 1991. We can count the years individually:

","To find out how many years after the beginning of the war Mauritania retreated and withdrew, we need to follow these steps:

1. Find the date when the war began.
2. Find the date when Mauritania retreated and withdrew.
3. Calculate the difference between the two dates to find the number of years.

From the table, we can see that the war began on 30 October 1975.

Mauritania retreated and withdrew in 1979, according to the ""Result"" section of the table.

Now, we need to calculate the difference between 1979 and 1975.

","To determine how many years after the beginning of the war PDR Ethiopia became a belligerent, let's break down the information provided in the table.

1. The Ethiopian Civil War began on 12 September 1974.
2. PDR Ethiopia (the Derg) was a belligerent until 1987, when it changed to PDR Ethiopia (1987-1991).
3. Therefore, PDR Ethiopia became a belligerent in 1974.

To find the number of years after the beginning of the war that PDR Ethiopia became a belligerent, we need to find the difference between the year it became a belligerent (1974) and the year the war started (1974).

However, it seems that PDR Ethiopia became a belligerent in the same year the war started. Therefore, the difference is 0 years.

","To answer the question, we need to follow these steps:

1. Identify the date of the first flight of the B-24 Skua.
2. Identify the date of introduction of the B-24 Skua.
3. Calculate the difference between the two dates to find out how many years passed between the first flight and the introduction.

From the table, we can see that:

- The first flight of the B-24 Skua was on 9 February 1937.
- The introduction of the B-24 Skua was in November 1938.

Now, let's calculate the difference between the two dates:

1938 - 1937 = 1 year

However, we need to consider the months as well. November 1938 is 9 months after February 1937.

So, we need to add the remaining months to the 1 year difference:

1 year + 9 months ≈ 1.75 years

But since the question asks for the number of years, we'll round down to 1 year, as the aircraft was introduced in November 1938, which is 1 year after the first flight in February 1937.

","To answer the question, we need to follow these steps:

1. Find the date of the first launch at the Satish Dhawan Space Centre.
2. Find the date of the first launch from the second launch pad.
3. Calculate the difference between the two dates to find the number of years.

Step 1: Find the date of the first launch at the Satish Dhawan Space Centre.
The first launch at the Satish Dhawan Space Centre was the SLV / Rohini RS-1, which occurred on 9 August 1979.

Step 2: Find the date of the first launch from the second launch pad.
The first launch from the second launch pad was the PSLV-G / Cartosat-1, which occurred on 5 May 2005.

Step 3: Calculate the difference between the two dates to find the number of years.
To calculate the difference, we need to find the number of years between 1979 and 2005.

The difference between 2005 and 1979 is 2005 - 1979 = 26.

However, this is the difference in years between the two launch years. Since the question asks for the number of years after the first launch at the Satish Dhawan"

","Step 1: Identify the inception date of the Kalmar Union.
From the table, we can see that the Kalmar Union was formed on 17 June 1397.

Step 2: Identify the start date of Eric of Pomerania's reign.
According to the table, Eric of Pomerania was the first monarch of the Kalmar Union, starting in 1397.

Step 3: Identify the end date of Eric of Pomerania's reign.
From the table, we can see that Eric of Pomerania's reign ended in 1442.

Step 4: Calculate the number of years after the inception of the Kalmar Union that Eric of Pomerania ended his reign.
To find the number of years, we subtract the inception date from the end date of Eric's reign: 1442 - 1397 = 45 years.

However, since Eric of Pomerania started his reign in the same year the Kalmar Union was formed, we need to subtract 1 from the result to get the correct number of years he reigned after the inception of the Kalmar Union: 45 - 1 = 44 years.

","To answer the question, we need to find the year of Argentina's first World Cup appearance and the year they won their first World Cup championship.

Step 1: Find the year of Argentina's first World Cup appearance.
In the table, it is mentioned that Argentina's first World Cup appearance was in 1930.

Step 2: Find the year Argentina won their first World Cup championship.
In the table, it is mentioned that Argentina won their first World Cup championship in 1978.

Step 3: Calculate the number of years between Argentina's first World Cup appearance and their first World Cup championship.
To find the number of years, we subtract the year of the first appearance (1930) from the year of the first championship (1978).
1978 - 1930 = 48 years

However, we are asked for years after their first World Cup appearance. Therefore, we should subtract the number of years from the year of the first World Cup championship.
1978 - 48 = 1930 is the year of the first World Cup appearance. Therefore, the years after the first World Cup appearance is 1978 - 1930 = 48.

","To find the answer, let's break down the problem step by step:

1. First, we need to find the year Brit Pettersen won the gold medal at the Junior World Championships. According to the table, she won the gold medal in 1980.

2. Next, we need to find the year Brit Pettersen turned 18. Her birth year is 1961, so she was born on November 24, 1961. Since the question asks ""after turning 18"", we'll consider the year she turned 18 as 1961 + 18 = 1979.

3. Now, we need to find the difference between the year she won the gold medal and the year she turned 18. The year she won the gold medal is 1980, and the year she turned 18 is 1979. However, since she won the gold medal in 1980, we need to subtract 1979 from 1980 to find the number of years after turning 18 that she won the gold medal.

4. Subtracting 1979 from 1980 gives us 1.

","To find the number of years ago Mars Express performed orbital insertion, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the date of orbital insertion: The table states that Mars Express performed orbital insertion on December 25, 2003.

2. Identify the current date: We are assuming the current date is December 2022.

3. Calculate the difference between the current year and the year of orbital insertion: Since the current year is 2022 and the year of orbital insertion is 2003, we subtract 2003 from 2022 to get the number of years that have passed.

4. Perform the calculation: 2022 - 2003 = 19

Therefore, Mars Express performed orbital insertion 19 years ago.

Predecessor	Karađorđe

House	Obrenović
Father	Teodor Mihailović
Mother	Višnja Urošević
Religion	Serbian Orthodox

","To answer the question, we need to find out the year Miloš Obrenović I died and then calculate how many years ago that was.

Step 1: Find the year Miloš Obrenović I died.
From the table, we can see that Miloš Obrenović I died on 26 September 1860.

Step 2: Determine the current year.
Since the current date is December 2022, we will use this as the current year.

Step 3: Calculate how many years ago Miloš Obrenović I died.
To find out how many years ago Miloš Obrenović I died, we subtract the year he died from the current year: 2022 - 1860 = 162.

However, we need to consider that Miloš Obrenović I could have been 77 or 80 years old when he died. This means his death year could be 1860 or 1839 (77 years before his birth year is unknown). But his birth year is known as 1783. 1839 would be 183 years ago, 1860 would be 162 years ago. Therefore, considering the information we have, the answer would be 162 years ago.

","To find the number of years ago that Australia's first test in cricket was, we need to follow these steps:

1. Find the date of Australia's first test in cricket.
2. Determine the current year (which is 2022).
3. Calculate the difference between the current year and the year of the first test to find the number of years ago.

Let's start by finding the date of Australia's first test in cricket:

From the table, we can see that Australia's first test was on ""15-19 March 1877"".

Now, we need to find the current year, which is already given as 2022.

Next, we calculate the difference between the current year and the year of the first test:

2022 (current year) - 1877 (year of first test) = 1445

However, this is the number of years since the first test. To find the number of years ago, we need to subtract this number from the current year:

2022 - 1445 = 577

But that's not correct, as we want to know how many years ago the first test was, and the first test was in 1877, so we need to calculate the difference between the current year and the year of"

","To find the answer, we need to follow these steps:

1. Find the date when Brazil was declared a republic.
2. Determine the current year (given that the current date is December 2022).
3. Subtract the date of declaration from the current year to find the number of years that have passed.
4. Since we are looking for the number of years ago that Brazil was declared a republic, we will subtract the result from the current year.

Step 1: Find the date when Brazil was declared a republic.
From the table, we can see that Brazil declared its republic on November 15, 1889.

Step 2: Determine the current year.
The current year is 2022.

Step 3: Subtract the date of declaration from the current year to find the number of years that have passed.

Step 4: Subtract the result from the current year to find the number of years ago that Brazil was declared a republic.
Since we want to find the number of years ago, we will keep the result from step 3.

4.  To find the number of years ago that Scottie Pippen was awarded NBA steals leader, we need to subtract the year he was awarded from the current year.
5.  Subtract 1995 from 2022 to get the number of years ago.

Now, let's perform the subtraction:

2022 - 1995 = 27

","To determine how many years ago Yale University was named Collegiate School, we need to follow these steps:

1. Find the year when Yale University was named Collegiate School: 
   The table mentions that Yale University was named Collegiate School from 1701 to 1718.

2. Identify the current year or the year of the given information: 
   The table mentions that the endowment of Yale University was $42.3 billion in 2021.

3. Calculate the difference between the current year (or the year of the given information) and the year when Yale University was named Collegiate School:
   Since we are given the year 2021, we will use it to calculate the difference. The difference between 2021 and 1701 is 320 years.

4. Since the question asks how many years ago Yale University was named Collegiate School, we need to subtract the year it was renamed (1718) from the current year (2021), but we need to find the year it was named Collegiate School (1701). So the difference is simply the difference between the current year and 1701 which is 320 years.

2. Determine the current year: Although the current date is not explicitly mentioned in the table, it's given as December, 2022.

3. Calculate the difference between the current year and the year the Supreme Court was established: Subtract 1948 from 2022 to find the number of years since its establishment.

4. Since we are asked how many years ago it was established, we need to subtract the year of establishment from the current year.

2022 - 1948 = 74

So, the Supreme Court of Israel was established 74 years ago.

2. The second biggest defeat is mentioned as 'Australia 0-5 Japan | (Pekanbaru, Indonesia; 15 July 2012)'. This means the year of the second biggest defeat is 2012.

Now, we need to find the difference between these two years to determine how many years apart they were.

To find the difference, we subtract the smaller year from the larger year:
2012 - 1992 = 20

Therefore, Australia's two biggest defeats were 20 years apart.

","To find the answer to the question, we need to determine the year Jeelani's NBA career ended and then calculate the difference between that year and the year he died.

Step 1: Find the year Jeelani's NBA career ended.
From the table, we can see that Jeelani played in the NBA from 1976 to 1989. Therefore, his NBA career ended in 1989.

Step 2: Find the year Jeelani died.
From the table, we can see that Jeelani died on August 3, 2016.

Step 3: Calculate the difference between the year Jeelani's NBA career ended and the year he died.
To find the difference, we subtract the year his NBA career ended (1989) from the year he died (2016). 

2016 - 1989 = 27

However, the question asks how many years before Jeelani died his NBA career ended. This means we should be looking at how many years before 2016 his NBA career ended.

Since 1989 is 27 years before 2016, but the question asks how many years before Jeelani died, we can say that Jeelani's NBA career ended 27 years before"

To find the answer, we need to determine the year Stephen Hawking died and the year he won the Copley Medal, then calculate the difference between the two years.

1. From the table, we can see that Stephen Hawking died on 14 March 2018.
2. From the table, we can also see that Stephen Hawking won the Copley Medal in 2006.
3. To find the difference between the two years, we subtract the year he won the Copley Medal from the year he died: 2018 - 2006 = 12

","To find the answer, we need to determine the year Art Carney last got married and then subtract that from the year he died.

From the table, we can see that Art Carney was married twice after 1965. 

The first marriage after 1965 was to Barbara Isaac in 1966. 

The second marriage after 1965 was to Jean Myers in 1980.

Art Carney died in 2003.

So, the two possible years for his last marriage are 1966 and 1980.

Now, we need to find out how many years before he died he got married in each case.

If he got married in 1966, then the difference between 2003 and 1966 is 37 years.

If he got married in 1980, then the difference between 2003 and 1980 is 23 years.

Since the question asks for the number of years before he died, the correct answer will be the smaller of the two differences.

Final Answer: The final answer is 23."

","To answer the question, let's break it down into steps.

Step 1: Identify the dates related to Peter III's reign as King of Sicily.
From the table, we see that Peter III began his reign as King of Sicily on 4 September 1282.

Step 2: Identify the date of Peter III's death.
From the table, we see that Peter III died in November 1285.

Step 3: Calculate the duration of Peter III's reign as King of Sicily.
Since we are given the start date (4 September 1282) and the end date (November 1285), we need to calculate the exact number of years. However, since the end date is a month and not a specific day, we can't calculate the exact number of years without assuming the exact end date.

Step 4: Since we can't calculate the exact number of years, let's calculate the minimum and maximum number of years.
The minimum number of years can be calculated by subtracting the start year from the end year, which is 1285 - 1282 = 3. However, this is not the correct answer since we need to account for the extra months in the end year.

2. The protests started on 2 February 2021.
3. To find out how many years before the protests the general election results occurred, we subtract the year of the protests (2021) from the year of the general election (2020).
4. 2020 - 2021 = -1

However, since we are looking for the number of years before the protests, the negative sign indicates that the general election occurred after the protests. But the question asks how many years before the 2021 Myanmar protests did the general election results occur, which the protesters want to recognize, which means the protesters want to recognize the results that occurred before the protests, which is the 2020 general election.

","To find the number of years between Albert Michelson's first and last award, we need to identify the years of the first and last awards.

Step 1: Identify the year of the first award.
The first award mentioned is the Matteucci Medal, which Albert Michelson received in 1903.

Step 2: Identify the year of the last award.
The last award mentioned is the Duddell Medal and Prize, which Albert Michelson received in 1929.

Step 3: Calculate the number of years between the first and last award.
To find the number of years between the first and last award, we subtract the year of the first award from the year of the last award.

Years between first and last award = Year of last award - Year of first award
= 1929 - 1903
= 26

","To find the answer to the question, let's break down the information provided in the table.

1. We are looking for the years in which ""Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer"" voiced by Billie Mae Richards was a television special. 
2. In the table, we find the information that Billie Mae Richards voiced the character in the TV specials from 1964 to 2010.

Since the question asks for the years in which Billie Mae Richards voiced the character, we need to determine the duration of her involvement. To do this, we subtract the start year from the end year.

End year: 2010
Start year: 1964
Duration: 2010 - 1964 = 46 years

However, the question asks for how many years ""Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer"" voiced by Billie Mae Richards ran as a television special. Given that Billie Mae Richards voiced the character from 1964 to 2010, we can conclude that the special ran for 46 years, but this is the duration of her involvement, not the special itself.

The special itself was first released in 1964 and continued to be produced and aired for several years after Billie Mae Richards stopped"

","To find the number of years Ingenuity flew, we need to calculate the time period it was operational.

1. First, we need to find the date of the first flight and the last flight.
   - First flight: 19 April 2021
   - Last flight: 11 June 2022

2. Since we are asked for the number of years, we will find the difference in years between these two dates.

3. To do this, we can find the difference in months and then divide by 12 to get the approximate number of years.

   - The difference in months between 2021 and 2022 is 12 months.

4. Now, let's calculate the difference in days between the first and last flight dates to see how long Ingenuity flew within that year.

   - First flight: 19 April 2021
   - Last flight: 11 June 2022

   We can calculate the difference in days by finding the difference between the two dates. However, since the last flight date is in 2022, we can simply consider it as a year after the first flight.

","To find out how many years Mohammad Yamin served as Minister of National Education, let's break down the information provided in the table.

1. The table states that Mohammad Yamin served as the 8th Minister of National Education.
2. The ""In office"" period for this position is given as 30 July 1953 - 12 August 1955.
3. To find the duration of his service, we need to calculate the difference between the end and start dates.

The start date is 30 July 1953, and the end date is 12 August 1955.

We can calculate the duration by subtracting the start year from the end year and then subtracting the start month and day from the end month and day.

The end year (1955) - start year (1953) = 2 years
The end month (August) is after the start month (July), so we don't need to subtract any months.
The end day (12) is after the start day (30), so we need to subtract 30 - 12 = 18 days from the 2 years.

However, since we are calculating years, we can ignore the days. Therefore, the duration is approximately 2 years.

","To find out how many years Peter III reigned as King of Sicily, we need to determine the duration of his reign. 

1. We see that Peter III's reign as King of Sicily started on September 4, 1282, and ended on November 1285.
2. We need to find the exact end date of his reign to calculate the duration. Since the end date is given as November 1285, we assume it to be November 30, 1285 (as the exact date is not specified).
3. Now, we calculate the duration of his reign by subtracting the start date from the end date. 
   Start date: September 4, 1282
   End date: November 30, 1285
   Duration = End date - Start date = 1285-1282 = 3 years

However, we need to consider the months as well. September 4, 1282, to December 31, 1282, is 3 months and 28 days. January 1, 1283, to December 31, 1284, is 1 year and 12 months. January 1, 1285, to November 30, 1285"

","To answer the question, let's break it down step by step.

Step 1: Identify the stints of Scottie Pippen in the Chicago Bulls.
From the table, we can see that Scottie Pippen played for the Chicago Bulls in two separate periods:
- 1987-1998
- 2003-2004

Step 2: Determine the years of each stint.
- First stint: 1987-1998 (11 years)
- Second stint: 2003-2004 (1 year)

Step 3: Calculate the number of years between the two stints.
To find the number of years between the two stints, we need to subtract the end year of the first stint from the start year of the second stint. However, we are looking for the years in between, so we need to find the difference between the end year of the first stint and the start year of the second stint, then subtract one from that difference.

The end year of the first stint is 1998 and the start year of the second stint is 2003. 

1998 - 2003 = -5

Since we are looking for the years between the two stints, we need to add one to the difference to account"

","To determine the number of years Roy Emerson played at an amateur level until he turned pro, we need to follow these steps:

1. Identify the year Roy Emerson turned pro.
2. Identify the year Roy Emerson started his amateur tour.
3. Calculate the difference between the two years to find the number of years he played at an amateur level.

Step 1: Identify the year Roy Emerson turned pro.
From the table, we see that Roy Emerson turned pro in 1968.

Step 2: Identify the year Roy Emerson started his amateur tour.
From the table, we see that Roy Emerson started his amateur tour in 1953.

Step 3: Calculate the difference between the two years.
To find the number of years Roy Emerson played at an amateur level, we subtract the start year (1953) from the year he turned pro (1968).
1968 - 1953 = 15

Therefore, Roy Emerson played at an amateur level for 15 years until he turned pro.

","To find out how many years it took Sri Lanka to become a full ICC member after becoming an Associate member, let's break down the information given in the table.

1. The table mentions that Sri Lanka became an Associate Member in 1965.
2. It also mentions that Sri Lanka acquired Test status and became a Full Member in 1981.

Now, we need to find the difference between these two years to determine how many years it took for Sri Lanka to become a full ICC member after becoming an Associate member.

1981 - 1965 = 16

So, it took Sri Lanka 16 years to become a full ICC member after becoming an Associate member.

Final Answer: The final answer is 16."

","To find the answer, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the year of Claire Leroy's first bronze medal.
2. Determine the year of her first gold medal.
3. Calculate the difference between the two years to find out how many years it took for her to win a gold medal after her first bronze medal.

Step 1: From the table, we can see that Claire Leroy won a bronze medal in 2004 Annapolis and in 2005 Hamilton. We need to determine which year is her first bronze medal. Since 2004 is before 2005, 2004 is her first bronze medal.

Step 2: Next, we need to find the year of her first gold medal. According to the table, she won a gold medal in 2007 Saint Quay. This is her first gold medal.

Step 3: Now, we calculate the difference between the year of her first gold medal (2007) and the year of her first bronze medal (2004). The difference is 2007 - 2004 = 3 years.

","To find the answer, let's break down the information provided in the table.

1. Sri Lanka initially attained Associate Member status in 1965.
2. It became a Full Member in 1981.

Now, let's calculate the time difference between these two events:

1981 (Full Member status) - 1965 (Associate Member status) = 16 years

Therefore, it took Sri Lanka 16 years to become a full member after attaining its Associate Member ICC status.

","To find the number of years it took for inflation in France to decrease by 0.8%, we need to examine the table and identify the years in which the inflation rate changed.

From the table, we see that the inflation rates for the years 2018, 2019, and 2020 are 2.1%, 1.3%, and 0.5%, respectively.

To find the number of years it took for inflation to decrease by 0.8%, we need to find two consecutive years with an inflation rate difference of at least 0.8%.

Looking at the inflation rates, we see that the difference between 2.1% (2018) and 1.3% (2019) is 0.8%. However, we are asked to find the number of years it took for inflation to decrease by 0.8%, not the difference between two consecutive years.

Since the inflation rate decreased from 2.1% to 1.3% over a period of 1 year, we can conclude that it took 1 year for inflation in France to decrease by 0.8%.

","To find out how many years it took for the Human Development Index (HDI) of France to grow by 0.089 points, we need to follow these steps:

1.  First, we need to find the initial HDI value and the final HDI value. The initial HDI value is given as 0.909, and the final HDI value is also 0.909. However, we can find the initial HDI value for the IHDI as 0.820. 
2.  Since the initial and final HDI values are the same, we can't directly find the growth. Therefore, we should find the IHDI value for the initial year as 0.820 and the HDI value for the final year as 0.909. 
3.  We can assume that the IHDI is the initial HDI value for the year 2019. Therefore, the initial IHDI value is 0.820. 
4.  The final HDI value is 0.909, which is the value for the year 2020. Therefore, the growth in HDI is 0.909 - 0.820 = 0.089 points.

","To find the answer, let's break it down step by step.

Step 1: Identify the first single released from the album 14 Shades of Grey.
From the table, we can see that the first single released was ""Price to Play"" on April 1, 2003.

Step 2: Identify the fourth single released from the album 14 Shades of Grey.
From the table, we can see that the fourth single released was ""How About You"" on December 23, 2003.

Step 3: Determine the release dates of the first and fourth singles.
The first single was released on April 1, 2003, and the fourth single was released on December 23, 2003.

Step 4: Calculate the time difference between the release dates of the first and fourth singles.
To find the time difference, we need to subtract the release date of the first single from the release date of the fourth single.

December 23, 2003 - April 1, 2003 = 8 months

Since we're asked for the number of years, we need to convert the months to years.

There are approximately 12 months in a year. To convert 8 months to years, we divide by 12.

","To find the answer to the question, let's break it down step by step:

1. We need to find the information related to the rebuilding of the Palace of Westminster. We can see that under the ""Built"" and ""Demolished"" sections, there is information about a fire in 1834 that led to the demolition of the palace. However, we are looking for the rebuilding period.

2. The relevant information can be found under the ""Rebuilt"" section, which states that the palace was rebuilt from 1840 to 1876.

3. To find the number of years it took to rebuild the palace, we need to find the difference between the end year (1876) and the start year (1840).

4. The difference between 1876 and 1840 is 36 years.

Therefore, the final answer to the question is:

","To determine how many years the B-24 Skua flew before it was completely retired, we need to follow these steps:

1. Identify the date when the B-24 Skua was first introduced.
   From the table, we can see that the B-24 Skua was introduced in November 1938.

2. Identify the date when the B-24 Skua was completely retired.
   From the table, we can see that the B-24 Skua was completely retired in March 1945.

3. Calculate the time difference between the retirement date and the introduction date.
   The B-24 Skua was introduced in 1938 and retired in 1945. To find the time difference, we subtract the introduction year from the retirement year:
   1945 - 1938 = 7

However, we also need to consider the partial retirement in 1941. To get the total time the B-24 Skua flew, we'll need to calculate the time difference between the introduction date and the partial retirement date, and then add the time difference between the partial retirement date and the complete retirement date.

","To find out how many years the Coordination Center for Ethnic Germans remained operational, we need to determine the period of time it existed.

From the table, we can see that the Coordination Center was formed around 1937 and dissolved on May 8, 1945.

Step 1: Determine the year the Coordination Center was formed.
- The Coordination Center was formed around 1937.

Step 2: Determine the year the Coordination Center was dissolved.
- The Coordination Center was dissolved on May 8, 1945.

Step 3: Calculate the number of years the Coordination Center remained operational.
- To find the number of years, we need to subtract the year it was formed from the year it was dissolved.
- Since the Coordination Center was formed around 1937, we will use 1937 as the starting year.
- The Coordination Center was dissolved on May 8, 1945, so we will use 1945 as the ending year.
- Subtract the starting year from the ending year: 1945 - 1937 = 8

Therefore, the Coordination Center for Ethnic Germans remained operational for 8 years.

","To find the duration of the Ethiopian-Adal war, we need to look at the table under the section ""Ethiopian-Adal war"".

Q: How many years did the Ethiopian-Adal war last?

From the table, we see that the Ethiopian-Adal war started in 1529 and ended in 1543.

Now, let's calculate the duration: 
1543 (end year) - 1529 (start year) = 14 years

Therefore, the Ethiopian-Adal war lasted for 14 years.

","To find the answer, we need to follow these steps:

1. Identify the date when Valen Chapel was closed.
2. Identify the date when Valen Chapel was consecrated.
3. Calculate the difference between the two dates to find the number of years.

From the table, we can see that:

- Valen Chapel was closed from 1873 to 1949. This means it was closed for 76 years (1949 - 1873 = 76).
- Valen Chapel was consecrated on July 31, 1949.

Since the consecration took place after the chapel was closed, we need to find the year when the chapel was closed and consecrated. However, the question asks for the years after the chapel was closed, not before.

Given that the chapel was consecrated in 1949, and it was closed for 76 years before that, we need to consider the time after the chapel was closed, not before.

Therefore, the consecration of Valen Chapel took place after it was closed for 76 years, but the question asks for the years after the chapel was closed, not before.

To answer the question correctly, we need to find the time difference between the consecration and the year the chapel was closed,"

Breaking down these dates:
- The year he started ruling is 1513.
- The year he stopped ruling is 1523.

To find the number of years he ruled, we subtract the year he started ruling from the year he stopped ruling: 1523 - 1513 = 10.

Therefore, the last monarch of the Kalmar Union, Christian II, ruled for 10 years.

","Let's break down the information provided in the table to answer the question.

1. We need to find Steve Austin's first retirement date.
   - According to the table, Steve Austin's first retirement was on March 30, 2003.

2. We need to find Steve Austin's return match date.
   - According to the table, Steve Austin's return match was on April 2, 2022.

3. Now, we need to calculate the difference between these two dates to find the number of years elapsed.
   - To do this, we subtract the year of the first retirement from the year of the return match: 2022 - 2003 = 19 years.

However, we also need to consider the month and day of the year for an accurate calculation. Since the return match occurred in April, and the first retirement occurred in March, we should consider the entire year of 2003 as part of the elapsed time.

4. Therefore, the number of years elapsed between Steve Austin's first retirement and his return match is 19 years.

Final Answer: The final answer is 19."

","To find the number of years elapsed between the reigns of Prince of Serbia for Miloš Obrenović I, we need to identify the start and end dates of his two reigns as Prince of Serbia.

From the table, we can see that Miloš Obrenović I was Prince of Serbia from 6 November 1817 to 25 June 1839.

First, we need to find the duration of his first reign as Grand Vožd of Serbia, which is not required to answer the question, but it is required to find the start date of his first reign as Prince of Serbia.

The start date of his first reign as Grand Vožd of Serbia is 23 April 1815, and the end date is 6 November 1817. 

Now, we can find the duration of his first reign as Prince of Serbia by subtracting the start date (6 November 1817) from the end date (25 June 1839). However, we need to find the start date of his first reign as Prince of Serbia. We can see that it is the same as the end date of his first reign as Grand Vožd of Serbia (6 November 1817).

","To find the answer, let's break down the problem into steps.

1. Find the date when Patricia McCoy became House Minority Leader. 
From the table, we see that Patricia McCoy became House Minority Leader on January 8, 2019.

2. Find the date of the next general election.
From the table, we see that the next general election was held on November 4, 2022.

3. Calculate the time elapsed between the two dates. 
First, we need to convert both dates into the same format. We can use the format 'Year-Month-Day'. 
Patricia McCoy became House Minority Leader on '2019-01-08' and the next general election was held on '2022-11-04'.

4. Now, we calculate the time elapsed. 
We subtract the earlier date from the later date:
'2022-11-04' - '2019-01-08' = 3 years, 9 months, and 27 days.

However, since the question asks for the number of years elapsed, we will consider only the years. 
So, the number of years elapsed is 3.

Final Answer: The final answer is 3."

","To find the answer, we need to identify the start and end dates of Bayinnaung's reign as Suzerain of Lan Na and his first reign as Suzerain of Lan Xang, and then calculate the time difference between these two dates.

From the table, we can see that Bayinnaung's reign as Suzerain of Lan Na started on 2 April 1558 and ended on 10 October 1581. However, his first reign as Suzerain of Lan Xang started on 2 January 1565 and ended on early 1572.

Now, we need to calculate the time difference between these two dates. 

1. Start date of the first reign as Suzerain of Lan Na: 2 April 1558
2. End date of the first reign as Suzerain of Lan Xang: early 1572

Since the exact date of the end of Bayinnaung's first reign as Suzerain of Lan Xang is not specified, we will assume that it is sometime in 1572.

","Let's break down the information provided to answer the question step by step.

1. First, we need to identify the year James Worthy won the NCAA Championship. This information can be found in the ""Career highlights and awards"" section of the table. We see that James Worthy won the NCAA champion in 1982.

2. Next, we need to identify the year James Worthy started his professional career. This information can be found in the ""Career information"" section of the table. We see that James Worthy was drafted in 1982 and started his playing career in 1982.

3. Since we know the year James Worthy won the NCAA Championship and the year he started his professional career, we can calculate the number of years he had been playing professionally when he won the NCAA Championship. To do this, we subtract the year he started his professional career from the year he won the NCAA Championship. So, 1982 - 1982 = 0 years.

However, this is incorrect, since we know that James Worthy had played college basketball before turning pro. We need to find the year he graduated from college. This information can be found in the ""College"" section of the table. We see that James Worthy attended North Carolina"

","To find the answer to the question, let's break it down step by step.

Step 1: Identify the relevant information in the table related to the question.
From the table, we see that the years AC/DC has been active are listed as ""1973 |  ( | 1973 | ) | -present"".

Step 2: Interpret the information to determine the time period during which AC/DC has been active.
The years listed indicate that AC/DC started in 1973 and is still active as of the current year (2022). The ""( | )"" seems to be a formatting error and can be ignored.

Step 3: Calculate the number of years AC/DC has been a band.
Since AC/DC started in 1973 and is still active in 2022, we need to calculate the difference between the current year and the year they started. However, we don't know the exact year we are in but since we are in December 2022, we can safely say that AC/DC has been a band for 49 years as of 2022.

The table mentions that AC/DC has been active since 1973 and is still active to the present.

Step 2: Determine the range of years AC/DC has been performing.
Since AC/DC started in 1973 and is still active, we need to consider the current year (2022) as the end of the range.

Step 3: Calculate the number of years AC/DC has been performing.
To find the number of years, subtract the start year (1973) from the current year (2022).

1. We see that B.J. Neufeld has been associated with two member associations: Manitoba and Alberta.
2. We are given two time periods for each association:

   - For Alberta, the time period is from 2018 to 2022.
3. To find the total number of years, we need to calculate the years for each association separately and then add them up.
4. For Manitoba, B.J. Neufeld was associated with the member association from 2007 to 2018 (12 years) and then again from 2022 to the present. Since we don't know the exact year the question was asked, we will assume the current year is 2022. Therefore, he has been associated with the member association for 1 year in 2022.

","To answer the question, let's break it down step by step.

Step 1: Identify the relevant information in the table related to Benedict Cumberbatch's acting career.
The relevant information is in the ""Years active"" row, which states ""1998-present"".

Step 2: Determine the time period during which Benedict Cumberbatch has been acting.
Since the information is given as ""1998-present"", we need to calculate the duration from 1998 to the current year (2022).

Step 3: Calculate the duration by subtracting the starting year from the current year.
Duration = Current year - Starting year
Duration = 2022 - 1998
Duration = 24 years

However, the question asks for the number of years Benedict Cumberbatch has been acting, which implies the duration from his start of acting to the current year (2022), not the duration from 1998 to 2022.

Since the question is about the number of years he has been acting, not the duration since 1998, we should instead calculate the duration from 1998 to the year when he was born, which is 1976, and then add the number of years from his birth to the current year.

2. We are asked to find out how many years it has been since the V/Line Corporation was formed as a statutory corporation.
3. To calculate this, we need to know the current year and subtract the year the V/Line Corporation was formed.

Since the current date is December 2022, the current year is 2022.

","To find the answer, let's follow the steps:

1. Find the introduction year of the JF-17 Thunder in China.
   - The introduction year is mentioned in the table as ""12 March 2007"".
   - We need to convert this date into a year that we can use for calculation.

2. Since the introduction year is given as ""12 March 2007"", we can assume that this is the year when the JF-17 Thunder was first introduced in China.

3. To find out how many years the JF-17 Thunder has been used in China, we need to subtract the introduction year from the current year (2022).
   - Current year: 2022
   - Introduction year: 2007
   - Years used in China: 2022 - 2007 = 15 years

Therefore, the JF-17 Thunder has been used in China for 15 years.

1. The table is about the album ""14 Shades of Grey"" by the band Staind.
2. It mentions the release date of the album, which is May 20, 2003.
3. It also mentions the chronology of Staind's albums, which includes ""14 Shades of Grey"" followed by ""Chapter V"".
4. The release date of ""Chapter V"" is not provided in the table, but we can find it by looking up the information.

According to external information, the album ""Chapter V"" by Staind was released on September 28, 2005.

Now, let's calculate the time difference between the release dates of the two albums:

Release date of ""14 Shades of Grey"": May 20, 2003
Release date of ""Chapter V"": September 28, 2005

To find the number of years between these two dates, we subtract the earlier date from the later date:

","To find the length of the last reign of the Kalmar Union, we need to identify the last monarch and the start and end dates of their reign.

Q: Who was the last monarch of the Kalmar Union?

From the table, we can see that the last monarch of the Kalmar Union was Christian II. He ruled from 1513-23.

Q: What were the start and end dates of Christian II's reign?

The start date of Christian II's reign was 1513 and the end date was 1523.

Q: How many years long was Christian II's reign?

To find the length of Christian II's reign, we need to subtract the start date from the end date. 

Length of reign = End date - Start date
= 1523 - 1513
= 10 years

Therefore, Christian II's reign was 10 years long.

1. First, let's find the duration of Hewitt's college career. He attended Mt. SAC from 1964-1966 and then USC from 1966-1968. Therefore, his college career lasted from 1964 to 1968, which is 4 years.

2. Next, let's find the duration of Hewitt's NBA career. He played in the NBA from 1968 to 1974. Therefore, his NBA career lasted from 1968 to 1974, which is 6 years.

3. Now, we need to find the difference in years between the two periods. To do this, we subtract the duration of Hewitt's college career from the duration of his NBA career: 6 years (NBA) - 4 years (college) = 2 years.

Therefore, Hewitt's NBA career lasted 2 years longer than his college career.

","To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. Identify the planned mission duration of the orbiter.
2. Identify the elapsed duration of the orbiter.
3. Subtract the elapsed duration from the planned duration to find the difference.

Step 1: Identify the planned mission duration of the orbiter.
The planned mission duration of the orbiter is mentioned as ~ 7.5 years.

Step 2: Identify the elapsed duration of the orbiter.
The elapsed duration of the orbiter is mentioned as 2 years, 10 months.

To make the comparison easier, we'll convert both durations to years. Since there are 12 months in a year, we can convert 10 months to years as follows:
10 months ≈ 10/12 ≈ 0.83 years (approximately)

So, the elapsed duration of the orbiter is approximately 2 + 0.83 = 2.83 years.

Step 3: Subtract the elapsed duration from the planned duration to find the difference.
Planned duration: 7.5 years
Elapsed duration: 2.83 years
Difference: 7.5 - 2.83 ≈ 4.67 years

Therefore, the orbiter's planned mission duration is approximately 4"

","To answer this question, we need to find out how many years Derrick Brooks was a player for the Tampa Bay Buccaneers and how many years he was an executive for the Tampa Bay Storm.

Step 1: Find the number of years Derrick Brooks was a player for the Tampa Bay Buccaneers.
From the table, we see that Derrick Brooks played for the Tampa Bay Buccaneers from 1995 to 2008. This is a period of 14 years (2008 - 1995 + 1).

Step 2: Find the number of years Derrick Brooks was an executive for the Tampa Bay Storm.
From the table, we see that Derrick Brooks was an executive for the Tampa Bay Storm from 2011 to 2017. This is a period of 7 years (2017 - 2011 + 1).

Step 3: Calculate the difference between the two periods to find out how many years longer Derrick Brooks was a player than an executive.
The difference between the two periods is 14 - 7 = 7 years.

","To find the answer, let's break down the information given in the table regarding Franchitti's IndyCar Series career and his NASCAR Camping World Truck Series career.

Step 1: Identify the duration of Franchitti's IndyCar Series career.
From the table, we see that Franchitti's IndyCar Series career spanned 11 years, with his first race being in 2002 and his last race being in 2013.

Step 2: Identify the duration of Franchitti's NASCAR Camping World Truck Series career.
From the table, we see that Franchitti's NASCAR Camping World Truck Series career spanned 1 year, with his first race being in 2007 and his last race being in the same year.

Step 3: Calculate the difference in years between the two careers.
To find the difference, we subtract the duration of the NASCAR Camping World Truck Series career from the duration of the IndyCar Series career.
11 years (IndyCar Series) - 1 year (NASCAR Camping World Truck Series) = 10 years

Therefore, Franchitti's IndyCar Series career was 10 years longer than his NASCAR Camping World Truck Series career.

","To solve this problem, we need to find the duration for which both Gagauzia and Tatarstan were unrecognized breakaway states.

From the table, we can see that:

- Gagauzia was an unrecognized breakaway state from 1990 to 1994.
- Tatarstan was an unrecognized breakaway state from 1992 to 1994.

Now, let's calculate the duration for each:

- Duration of Gagauzia's unrecognized status: 1994 - 1990 = 4 years
- Duration of Tatarstan's unrecognized status: 1994 - 1992 = 2 years

Now, let's find the difference in duration:

4 years (Gagauzia) - 2 years (Tatarstan) = 2 years

Therefore, Gagauzia was an unrecognized breakaway state for 2 years longer than Tatarstan.

","To find the difference in years between Gordon's NASCAR Xfinity Series career and his IndyCar Series career, we need to first determine the number of years each series lasted.

Gordon's NASCAR Xfinity Series career lasted for 9 years, as stated in the table: ""54 races run over 9 years"".

Gordon's IndyCar Series career lasted for 7 years, as stated in the table: ""8 races run over 7 years"".

Now, we need to subtract the number of years of the IndyCar Series career from the number of years of the NASCAR Xfinity Series career to find the difference.

9 (NASCAR Xfinity Series years) - 7 (IndyCar Series years) = 2

Therefore, Gordon's NASCAR Xfinity Series career was 2 years longer than his IndyCar Series career.

Leite's playing career started in 1967 and ended in 1989.

Leite's college career started in 1973 and ended in 1976.

Now, let's calculate the duration of each period:

Leite's playing career: 1989 - 1967 = 22 years

Leite's college career: 1976 - 1973 = 3 years

To find the difference in years, we subtract the duration of the college career from the duration of the playing career:

","To determine how many years longer Mauritania was a belligerent than France, we need to find the duration of their involvement in the Western Sahara War.

From the table, we see that Mauritania was a belligerent from 1975 to 1979, which is a total of 4 years.

France, on the other hand, was a belligerent from 1977-78 (Operation Lamantin) and also provided aid from 1978. This means France was a belligerent for at least 2 years (1 year for Operation Lamantin and 1 year for aid).

Now, let's compare the durations: 
Mauritania was a belligerent for 4 years, and France was a belligerent for 2 years.

The difference in duration is 4 years (Mauritania) - 2 years (France) = 2 years.

Therefore, Mauritania was a belligerent for 2 years longer than France.

","A: Let's think step by step.

Step 1: Identify the two terms of Mohammad-Ali Foroughi as the 22nd Prime Minister of Iran. 
From the table, we can see that his first term was from 27 August 1941 to 9 March 1942, and his second term was from 18 September 1933 to 3 December 1935.

Step 2: Calculate the duration of each term.
First term: 9 March 1942 - 27 August 1941 = 1 year and 4 months (approximately 16 months)
Second term: 3 December 1935 - 18 September 1933 = 2 years and 2 months (approximately 26 months)

Step 3: Convert the durations to years for easier comparison.
First term: 16 months ≈ 1.33 years
Second term: 26 months ≈ 2.17 years

Step 4: Find the difference in years between the two terms.
Difference = Second term - First term = 2.17 years - 1.33 years = 0.84 years

Since the question asks how many years longer the second term was than the first term, the answer is the positive value of"

House	Barcelona
Father	James I of Aragon
Mother	Violant of Hungary
Religion	Roman Catholicism

","To find the difference in the length of Peter III's reign as King of Aragon and Valencia and as King of Sicily, we need to determine the length of each reign.

From the table, we can see that Peter III's reign as King of Aragon and Valencia started on 27 July 1276 and ended in November 1285. 

To find the length of this reign, we need to calculate the difference between the start and end years. However, since the end year is given as 1285, we need to find the exact month of the end year to accurately calculate the length of the reign.

From the table, we can see that the exact end month is not provided, but it is mentioned as 'November 1285'. Since we cannot accurately determine the exact end date without the exact end month, we will assume that the end date is November 30, 1285.

The start year is 1276, and the end year is 1285. Therefore, the length of Peter III's reign as King of Aragon and Valencia is 1285 - 1276 = 9 years.

Next, we need to find the length of Peter III's reign as King of Sicily. From the table, we can see"

","To determine the difference in years between the first and second renovations at the Birmingham-Jefferson Convention Complex, we need to identify the years of the first and second renovations.

1. The table provides the year of the first renovation as 1976, but it also mentions that the complex was opened in January 1972. This suggests that the complex was opened before the first renovation, which took place in 1976.
2. The table mentions that the complex was renovated in 2009, but it also mentions that it was renovated from 2019-21. This indicates that the second renovation took place over a period of 2 years (from 2019 to 2021).
3. To find the difference in years between the first and second renovations, we need to subtract the year of the first renovation from the year of the last renovation. Since the first renovation took place in 1976 and the last renovation of the second renovation took place in 2021, we can calculate the difference as follows:
   2021 - 1976 = 45 years

","To solve this problem, we need to find the time difference between the fourth and fifth editions, and the time difference between the first and second editions, then subtract the latter from the former.

First, let's find the time between the fourth and fifth editions. The fifth edition was published in June 2015, and the fourth edition was published in 2007. 

Time between fourth and fifth editions = 2015 - 2007 = 8 years

Next, let's find the time between the first and second editions. The second edition was published in 1996, and the first edition was published in 1995.

Time between first and second editions = 1996 - 1995 = 1 year

Now, let's find the difference between the time between the fourth and fifth editions, and the time between the first and second editions.

Difference = Time between fourth and fifth editions - Time between first and second editions
= 8 years - 1 year
= 7 years

However, the question asks for how many years longer the time between the fourth and fifth editions was than between the first and second editions. Since the time between the fourth and fifth editions was 7 years, which is 7 years more than the time between"

","To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps.

**Step 1: Identify the relevant information from the table.**

- The B-24 Skua was withdrawn from the front line in 1941.
- The B-24 Skua was withdrawn from other duties in 1945.
- The B-24 Skua's first flight was on 9 February 1937.
- The B-24 Skua was introduced in November 1938.

**Step 2: Calculate the time between the first flight and introduction.**

- The first flight was on 9 February 1937.
- The introduction was in November 1938.
- To find the time difference, we need to find the number of years between these two dates.
- 1937 + 1 = 1938 (first year after the first flight)
- 1938 + 1 = 1939 (second year after the first flight)
- 1939 + 1 = 1940 (third year after the first flight)
- 1940 + 1 = 1941 (fourth year after the first flight)
- 1941 + 1 = 1942 (fifth year after the first flight)

","To solve this question, let's break it down into steps:

1.  We need to find the year when Billie Mae Richards stopped voicing Rudolph in the TV specials. According to the table, she voiced Rudolph from 1964 to 2010.
2.  So, the year when Billie Mae Richards stopped voicing Rudolph is 2010.
3.  Next, we need to find the year when Blitzen was Rudolph's father in the 1998 film.
4.  This means we are looking for the year 1998.
5.  Now, we need to calculate the difference between these two years to find out how many years passed between the end of the Billie Mae Richards TV specials and the film in which Blitzen was Rudolph's father.
6.  The difference between 2010 and 1998 is 12 years.

","To find the number of years passed between the first and last release of ""3 a.m. Eternal,"" we need to identify the release dates for both the first and last releases.

From the table, we can see that the first release of ""3 a.m. Eternal"" is mentioned as ""May 1989"" for the album ""The White Room,"" and the last release is mentioned as ""January 1992"" for the version ""The KLF vs ENT version.""

Now, let's calculate the difference between these two dates:

First release: May 1989
Last release: January 1992

We can break this down into two steps:
1. Find the difference in years between 1989 and 1992.
2. Consider any months that are not included in the full year.

The difference in years is 3 years (1992 - 1989 = 3).

Since January is the first month of 1992, we don't need to consider any months that are not included in the full year.

Therefore, the number of years passed between the first and last release of ""3 a.m. Eternal"" is 3 years.

","Q: How many years prior to Agustin I's rule was the Plan of Iguala?

To answer this question, we need to determine the year of the Plan of Iguala and the year of Agustin I's rule, then find the difference between the two.

From the table, we can see that the Plan of Iguala occurred on 24 February 1821.

We also know that Agustin I abdicated on 19 March 1823.

Since Agustin I's rule ended in 1823, we can assume that his rule began before 1823. However, to find the exact year, we need to look at the information provided for the Emperor position in the table.

According to the table, José Manuel de Herrera was the Emperor from 1822-1823. This implies that Agustin I's rule began before 1822, and it is mentioned that he abdicated in 1823, which suggests that he was the Emperor in 1822 and 1823. 

However, it is stated that Agustín I abdicated on 19 March 1823. It is also stated that Agustín I was the emperor in 1822 and 1823. Therefore, it can be concluded that"

","To answer this question, let's break it down step by step.

Step 1: Determine the year Cumberbatch turned 45.
We know Cumberbatch was born on 19 July 1976. To find the year he turned 45, we need to add 45 to his birth year.
1976 + 45 = 2021

Step 2: Identify the year the picture was taken.
The picture was taken in 2019, as mentioned in the table.

Step 3: Calculate the difference in years between the two dates.
To find out how many years prior to Cumberbatch turning 45 the picture was taken, we need to subtract the year the picture was taken from the year he turned 45.
2021 - 2019 = 2

Therefore, the picture was taken 2 years prior to Cumberbatch turning 45.

1. The Games of the XXXI Olympiad is mentioned in the table, and it took place on 9 August 2016. The 'XXXI' in the name indicates the Games were the 31st Olympiad. Since the first Olympiad took place in 776 BC, we can calculate the year of the 31st Olympiad.

2. To find the year of the 31st Olympiad, we first find the year of the first Olympiad (776 BC) and then add 31 times the interval between each Olympiad. The interval is typically 4 years (Summer and Winter Olympics). However, we'll use the Summer Olympics interval as the question doesn't specify Winter Olympics.

   Year of the first Olympiad = 776 BC
   Interval between each Olympiad = 4 years
   Year of the 31st Olympiad = 776 BC + (31 - 1) * 4 years

","To find the number of years that separated the X-15's first flight from its retirement, we need to follow these steps:

1. Identify the date of the X-15's first flight: The X-15's first flight was on 8 June 1959.

2. Identify the date of the X-15's retirement: The X-15 was retired in December 1968.

3. Calculate the difference between the two dates: To do this, we need to subtract the year of the first flight from the year of retirement, and then consider the difference in months. 

Since the first flight occurred in June 1959 and the X-15 was retired in December 1968, we can calculate the difference in years as follows:
- The difference in years is 1968 - 1959 = 9 years.

Considering the months, since the first flight occurred in June and the X-15 was retired in December, it's less than a year.

Therefore, the difference between the two dates is approximately 9 years.

   - The date when V/Line Corporation was formed as a State Transport Authority: 1 July 1983.
   - The date when V/Line Corporation became a statutory corporation: 1 October 2003.

1.  Aslam Watanjar was the Minister of Defense twice in his career:
   - First term: April - 28 July 1979
   - Second term: 6 March 1990 - April 1992

2.  To find the duration of each term, we need to subtract the start date from the end date:
   - First term: 28 July 1979 - April 1979 is not possible since the start date is after the end date. However, the correct end date for his first term is actually 14 September 1979. So the correct duration is April 1979 to 14 September 1979 is not possible. However, the correct end date for his first term is actually 14 September 1979, but the start date is April 1979, which is not possible. The correct start date for his first term is actually 28 July 1979, but the end date is actually 14 September 1979. So the correct duration for his first term is 28 July 1979 to 14 September 1979.

","To determine the number of years Belus Smawley's career was active since 1946, let's break down the information provided in the table.

1. We know that Belus Smawley played for the St. Louis Bombers from 1946-1950. This is a span of 4 years.
2. He then played for the Syracuse Nationals in 1950, which is 1 year.
3. Finally, he played for the Baltimore Bullets from 1950-1952, which is another 2 years.

Adding up these years, we get a total of 4 + 1 + 2 = 7 years.

However, this total includes the year 1950, which was counted twice (once for the St. Louis Bombers and once for the Syracuse Nationals). To correct this, we need to subtract 1 from the total.

7 - 1 = 6 years.

Therefore, Belus Smawley's career was active for 6 years since 1946.

1. Identify the date when Cheltenham Spa station first opened.
   - From the table, we see that Cheltenham Spa station opened on 30 March 1908.

2. Identify the date when Cheltenham Spa station first closed.
   - From the table, we see that Cheltenham Spa station first closed on 1 January 1917.

3. Calculate the duration between the opening date and the first closure date.
   - To find the duration, we subtract the opening date (30 March 1908) from the first closure date (1 January 1917).
   - Since the opening date is in March and the closure date is in January of the following year, we need to consider the full year of 1908 and then add the number of days from January to the closure date in 1917.

","To find the answer, let's break down the information provided in the table.

1. Cheltenham Spa station reopened on 7 July 1919.
2. The station was initially operational until it was closed on 1 January 1917, but this closure was short-lived as it reopened in 1919.
3. However, the station was closed again on 3 January 1966.

Since the question asks for the years the station was operational after reopening in 1919, we need to consider the time period between the reopening in 1919 and the final closure in 1966.

4. To find the duration, we subtract the year of reopening (1919) from the year of the final closure (1966).
5. This gives us 1966 - 1919 = 47 years.

However, we need to consider if the station was operational for the entire duration between 1919 and 1966.

","To determine the number of years Yale University was known as Collegiate School, we need to analyze the information provided in the table.

1. The table states that Yale University was formerly known as Collegiate School.
2. It also provides the years during which it was known as Collegiate School, which is 1701-1718.
3. To find the number of years, we need to subtract the starting year from the ending year.

Now, let's perform the calculation:

Ending year: 1718
Starting year: 1701
Number of years = Ending year - Starting year = 1718 - 1701 = 17

Therefore, Yale University was known as Collegiate School for 17 years.

","To find out how many years the Coordination Center for Ethnic Germans was operational from 1937, let's break down the information provided in the table.

1. The table mentions that the Coordination Center for Ethnic Germans was ""Formed c.1937"". This means it was formed around 1937, but not necessarily on a specific date in 1937.
2. The table also mentions that the Coordination Center for Ethnic Germans was ""Dissolved May 8, 1945"". This gives us the end date of its operation.
3. To find the number of years it was operational, we need to subtract the year it was formed (1937) from the year it was dissolved (1945).

Now, let's do the calculation:

1945 (dissolution year) - 1937 (formation year) = 8 years

Therefore, the Coordination Center for Ethnic Germans was operational for 8 years from 1937.

['Black rocket aircraft with stubby wings and short vertical stabilizers above and below tail unit', 'The X-15 pulling away from its drop launch plane']

","To find out how many years the X-15 was in service before it was retired, we need to determine the year it was retired and the year it was first introduced.

1. The X-15 was first introduced on 17 September 1959.
2. The X-15 was retired in December 1968.

Now, let's calculate the number of years it was in service:

1968 (retirement year) - 1959 (introduction year) = 9 years

However, we need to consider that the X-15 was first introduced in September 1959 and retired in December 1968. To accurately calculate the number of years, we should consider the full year of introduction (1959) and the full year of retirement (1968).

1959 (introduction year) to 1968 (retirement year) is 9 years.

Therefore, the X-15 was in service for 9 years before it was retired.

","To answer the question, let's break it down into steps:

Step 1: Identify the time period when the stadium was called Tractor Stadium. 
The table mentions that the stadium was previously known as Tractor Stadium from 1926-1940.

Step 2: Calculate the duration of this time period. 
The start year is 1926, and the end year is 1940. To find the duration, we subtract the start year from the end year: 1940 - 1926 = 14 years.

However, this is the duration from 1926 to 1940, not the number of years it was specifically called Tractor Stadium. It was called Tractor Stadium for the entire duration of 14 years, but the question asks how many years it was called Tractor Stadium, so we need to find the duration from 1926 to 1940, which is 14 years.

Step 3: Determine the answer based on the information gathered. 
The stadium was called Tractor Stadium for 14 years.

","To find the number of years between the start of Uzi Vogelman's term as Deputy President and the end of his jurist term, we need to follow these steps:

1. Identify the start date of Uzi Vogelman's term as Deputy President: 9 May 2022.
2. Identify the end date of his jurist term: 6 October 2024.
3. Calculate the difference between the two dates.

To calculate the difference, we can subtract the start date from the end date. We'll use the years and months to find the total number of months, then divide by 12 to find the total number of years.

Start date: 9 May 2022
End date: 6 October 2024

Since both dates are in the same year, we can simply count the months:
- From May 2022 to December 2022: 8 months
- From January 2023 to September 2023: 9 months
- From October 2023 to October 2024: 1 year

","To find the answer to the question, let's break down the information step by step.

1. The question asks for the duration of time B-24 Skuas were on the front line. This means we need to find the time period when they were actively used for military purposes.
2. Looking at the table, we see that the B-24 Skuas were ""Retired"" in two different years: 1941 (withdrawn from front line) and 1945 (withdrawn from other duties).
3. Since we're interested in the time they were on the front line, we can ignore the 1945 date and focus on the 1941 date.
4. The question asks for the number of years, so we need to find the difference between the year they were introduced (1938) and the year they were retired from the front line (1941).
5. To find the difference, we subtract the earlier year from the later year: 1941 - 1938 = 3 years.

","To find the number of years between Glock's best finish in his DTM career and his first best finish in his Champ Car career, we need to follow these steps:

1. Identify Glock's best finish in his DTM career:
   - According to the table, Glock's best finish in the championship in the DTM series was 5th in 2018 and 2020.

2. Identify Glock's first best finish in his Champ Car career:
   - According to the table, Glock's best finish in the championship in the Champ Car series was 8th in 2005.

3. Calculate the difference in years between the two best finishes:
   - Since both years (2018 and 2020 for DTM, and 2005 for Champ Car) are the same year for the best finishes, we will use the year of the first best finish in the DTM series which is 2018 and the year of the best finish in the Champ Car series which is 2005.
   - Therefore, the difference in years is 2018 - 2005 = 13 years.

However, since the question asks for the years between Glock's best finish in his DTM career and his first best finish in his Champ Car career,"

Place	Esztergom, Hungary, Austria-Hungary

Episcopal consecration
Principal consecrator	Diomede Falconio
Co-consecrators	Giacomo Ghezzi | Graziano Génnaro
Date	18 June 1892
Place	Rome, Italy

","To find the number of years between Mišić's ordination and consecration, we need to calculate the difference in years between the two dates.

Step 1: Identify the ordination and consecration dates.
From the table, we can see that Mišić was ordained on 7 July 1882 and consecrated on 18 June 1912.

Step 2: Calculate the difference in years between the two dates.
To do this, we can subtract the year of ordination from the year of consecration: 1912 - 1882 = 30.

However, we also need to consider the month and day of the dates. Since the consecration occurred in June 1912 and the ordination occurred in July 1882, we need to check if the consecration occurred before or after the ordination date in the same year.

Since the consecration date (18 June 1912) is before the ordination date in the same year (July 1882), we can simply use the year difference we calculated earlier.

Step 3: Determine the final answer.
Based on the calculation, the difference between Mišić's ordination and consecration is 30 years.

","To find the years between Pettersen's first gold medal and her last, we need to identify the years of her first and last gold medals.

Step 1: Find Pettersen's first gold medal.
- Pettersen's first gold medal was in the 1980 Junior World Championships, specifically in the 4 × 5 km relay.
- The year of the Junior World Championships is mentioned as 1980, which is also the year of her first gold medal.

","To determine the number of years between Carolijn Brouwer competing for the Netherlands and Belgium, we need to identify the years she competed for each country.

From the table, we can see that Carolijn Brouwer won a gold medal in the Laser Radial class in 1991, representing the Netherlands. 

We also know that she won a silver medal in the Tornado class in 2007, representing the Netherlands.

However, we are asked about the years between her competing for the Netherlands and Belgium. Unfortunately, there is no direct information in the table about the years she competed for Belgium.

But, since we do know the years she competed for the Netherlands, we can assume that she competed for Belgium at some point after 2007. Since we are not provided with the exact year she competed for Belgium, we cannot accurately calculate the number of years between her competing for the Netherlands and Belgium.

However, given that we do know that she won a silver medal in 2007, and she was born on July 25, 1973, which would make her 48 years old as of the current year (2022), it is possible to estimate the year she might have competed for Belgium.

","To find the difference in years between Esther Hayut's term as President and Uzi Vogelman's term as Deputy President, we need to calculate the remaining term for each of them.

For Esther Hayut:
- Her term ends on 16 October 2023.
- The current date is December 2022, which is before 2023.
- Since we are not given the exact date of the current month, we will assume it is in December 2022.

For Uzi Vogelman:
- His term ends on 6 October 2024.
- The current date is December 2022, which is before 2024.
- Therefore, we can calculate the remaining term in years by subtracting 2022 from 2024, which equals 2 years.

- Esther Hayut's remaining term is 1 year.
- Uzi Vogelman's remaining term is 2 years.
- The difference in years is 2 - 1 = 1 year.

1. We need to find Adolf von Baeyer's age when he got married.
2. To find his age at marriage, we need to know his birthdate and the date of his marriage.
3. From the table, we can see that Adolf von Baeyer was born on October 31, 1835.

","A: Let's think step by step.

Step 1: Identify the relevant information about Adolf von Baeyer's Nobel Prize for Chemistry from the table.
From the table, we see that Adolf von Baeyer won the Nobel Prize for Chemistry in 1905.

Step 2: Find the birthdate of Adolf von Baeyer.
According to the table, Adolf von Baeyer was born on 31 October 1835.

Step 3: Calculate Adolf von Baeyer's age when he won the Nobel Prize for Chemistry.
To calculate his age, we need to find the difference between his birth year and the year he won the Nobel Prize.
Adolf von Baeyer was born in 1835 and won the Nobel Prize in 1905.
So, his age at the time of the Nobel Prize is 1905 - 1835 = 70 years.

However, we need to consider that his birthday is on October 31st, so we need to check if the Nobel Prize was awarded before or after his birthday in 1905.
Since the Nobel Prize was awarded in 1905, it was awarded before his 71st birthday.

Therefore, Adolf von Baeyer was 70 years old when he won the Nobel Prize for Chemistry.

","To determine how old Albert A. Michelson was when he first got married, we need to find the year he got married and his birth year. 

1. The table mentions that Albert A. Michelson was born on December 19, 1852.
2. It also mentions that he got married to Margaret Hemingway in 1877.
3. To find his age at the time of marriage, we need to subtract his birth year from the year he got married. 

Age at marriage = Year of marriage - Birth year
Age at marriage = 1877 - 1852
Age at marriage = 25

So, Albert A. Michelson was 25 years old when he first got married.

Final Answer: The final answer is 25."

Since her birthdate is 14 September 1987, we can calculate her age as follows:

2014 (year of winning the gold medal) - 1987 (year of birth) = 27 years

However, this is not the correct answer. We need to find the exact date of the event. Since the table does not specify the exact date"

From the table, we can see that Alimuddin Zumla was born on May 15, 1955.

Step 2: Identify the relevant information in the table related to Alimuddin Zumla's awards.
From the table, we can see that Alimuddin Zumla won the Weber-Parkes Trust Medal in 1999.

From the table, we can see that Alphonse Gallegos became Auxiliary Bishop of Sacramento, but the exact date is not mentioned. However, we do know that he was appointed Bishop of Sacramento on 24 August 1981, and we can infer that he was likely appointed Auxiliary Bishop around the same time. 

The table also mentions that he was consecrated as a Bishop on 4 November 1981, but this is not necessarily the date he became Auxiliary Bishop.

","To answer the question, we need to find the year Stéphane Antiga first played for Paris Volley and then calculate his age at that time.

Step 1: Find the year Stéphane Antiga first played for Paris Volley. 
From the table, we see that his career information is listed under the 'Career' section. We need to find the year he started playing for Paris Volley. The information is provided in the format 'Years | Teams', but it seems to be a list of his entire career rather than a list of individual team stints.

However, we can infer that he played for Paris Volley between 1998-2003, as we see '1998-2003 | France | Paris Volley' in the list.

Step 2: Determine his age at the start of his stint with Paris Volley.
We know that Stéphane Antiga was born on 3 February 1976. To find his age in 1998, we subtract his birth year from 1998. 

1998 - 1976 = 22

Therefore, Stéphane Antiga was 22 years old when he first played for Paris Volley.

Step 2: Identify the relevant information about Arnold Schwarzenegger's marriage.
From the table, we find that Arnold Schwarzenegger got married to Maria Shriver in 1986.

","To find out how old Aslam Watanjar was when he took office as the Minister of Defence, we need to determine his age at the time of his first term as the Minister of Defence (1979) and his age at the time of his second term as the Minister of Defence (1990).

Step 1: Find the birth year of Aslam Watanjar.
From the table, we can see that Aslam Watanjar was born in 1946.

Step 2: Determine the age of Aslam Watanjar at the start of his first term as the Minister of Defence (1979).
To find his age in 1979, we subtract his birth year from 1979: 1979 - 1946 = 33.

Step 3: Determine the age of Aslam Watanjar at the start of his second term as the Minister of Defence (1990).
To find his age in 1990, we subtract his birth year from 1990: 1990 - 1946 = 44.

Since the question asks for the age at the time of his first term as the Minister of Defence, we will use the age calculated in Step 2.

","A: Let's think step by step.

Step 1: Identify the information related to Bev Francis's pro-debut. 
We see that Bev Francis made her pro-debut in 1983 at the Caesars World Cup.

Step 2: Identify the information related to Bev Francis's birthdate. 
We see that Bev Francis was born on 15 February 1955.

Step 3: Calculate Bev Francis's age at the time of her pro-debut. 
To do this, we need to find the difference between her birth year and the year she made her pro-debut. Since her birth year is 1955 and she made her pro-debut in 1983, we subtract 1955 from 1983 to get 28.

However, this is the difference in years, not the exact age. To find her exact age, we need to consider the difference in months and days as well. Since Bev Francis made her pro-debut in 1983 and her birthday is on 15 February, we only need to consider the months and days. In 1983, February has 28 days, so she would have turned 28 years old on 15 February 1983.

","To answer the question, we need to follow these steps:

1. Identify Bev Francis' pro-debut year: According to the table, Bev Francis made her pro-debut in 1983.

2. Identify Bev Francis' birth year: According to the table, Bev Francis was born in 1955.

3. Calculate Bev Francis' age when she turned pro: To find Bev Francis' age when she turned pro, we need to subtract her birth year from her pro-debut year. However, since the question asks for her age when she turned pro, we should subtract her birth year from the year after her pro-debut year because her age at the time of her pro-debut is what we are looking for.

4. Perform the calculation: 
   Pro-debut year: 1983
   Birth year: 1955
   Age = Pro-debut year - Birth year = 1983 - 1955 = 28

So, Bev Francis was 28 years old when she turned pro.

1. Identify the year Bill Hosket received the NBA champion award. 
   The table indicates that Bill Hosket was an NBA champion in 1970.

2. Determine Bill Hosket's age at the time of the award. 
   The table provides his birthdate as December 20, 1946. 

3. Calculate Bill Hosket's age in 1970. 
   To find his age in 1970, we need to subtract his birth year from 1970.

From the table, we can see that Charlotte Atkinson won a gold medal in the European Championships (LC) in 2018, in the 4×100 m mixed medley event.

2. The year she won this gold medal is 2018.

To find her age, we need to know her birthdate. According to the table, Charlotte Atkinson was born on 29 November 1996.

3. To find her age in 2018, we subtract her birth year from 2018: 2018 - 1996 = 22.

","Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. We need to find the information about Claire Leroy's birthdate and the year she won gold at the 2007 World Championships.

2. From the table, we can see that Claire Leroy was born on 9 March 1980.

3. We need to find the year she won gold at the 2007 World Championships. Looking at the ""Sailing"" section, we can see that she won a gold medal at the 2007 Saint Quay World Championships.

4. Now, we need to calculate her age when she won the gold medal. We can do this by subtracting her birth year from the year she won the gold medal.

5. Claire Leroy was born in 1980 and won the gold medal in 2007. So, we subtract 1980 from 2007, which gives us 27.

6. However, this is the age she was in 2007, but the question asks for her age at the time of the championship, which took place in 2007. Therefore, the age mentioned in the previous step is the correct age.

","To answer this question, we'll follow these steps:

1. Identify Derrell Palmer's birthdate from the table.
2. Identify the year Derrell Palmer entered the NFL draft from the table.
3. Calculate Derrell Palmer's age at the time of the NFL draft.

From the table, we can see that:

- Derrell Palmer was born on August 27, 1922.
- Derrell Palmer was drafted in the 6th round, 49th pick in the 1943 NFL Draft.

Now, let's calculate Derrell Palmer's age at the time of the NFL draft:

In the 1943 NFL Draft, Derrell Palmer was 20 years old (1943 - 1922 = 21, but since he was born in August, he was only 20 years old at the time of the draft).

However, since the question asks for his age when he entered the draft, we need to calculate it from the year he was born to the year of the draft.

","To find out how old Jeffrey Epstein was when he was apprehended, we need to follow these steps:

1. Find the date of birth of Jeffrey Epstein. From the table, we can see that his date of birth is January 20, 1953.

2. Find the date of apprehension of Jeffrey Epstein. From the table, we can see that he was apprehended on July 6, 2019.

3. Calculate the age of Jeffrey Epstein at the time of apprehension. To do this, we need to subtract his year of birth from the year of apprehension and then subtract the month and day of birth from the month and day of apprehension. 

Since Epstein was born on January 20, 1953, and apprehended on July 6, 2019, we calculate his age as follows:
- Year of apprehension - Year of birth = 2019 - 1953 = 66 years
- Month of apprehension > Month of birth, so we don't need to subtract months
- Day of apprehension > Day of birth, so we don't need to subtract days

Therefore, Jeffrey Epstein was 66 years old when he was apprehended.

Now, let's calculate his age during his first ARCA Menards Series race:

Since the exact date of the 1990 Atlanta Journal ARCA 500k (Atlanta) is not provided, we can assume it occurred in 1990. To calculate Robby Gordon's age in 1990, we need to subtract 1990 from his birth year (1969) and then add 1 (since he was one year old at the time of birth).

Age = Birth year - Year of the event + 1

","To determine how old Hasanefendić was when he managed his first team, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Identify Hasanefendić's first team as a manager**: Looking at the ""Teams managed"" section of the table, we can see a list of teams Hasanefendić managed throughout his career. His first team as a manager is listed as ""Yugoslavia"" in 1979.

2. **Identify Hasanefendić's birthdate**: We can find Hasanefendić's birthdate in the ""Personal information"" section of the table. His birthdate is August 1, 1948.

5. Since Jeelani played for the Dallas Mavericks in 1980-1981, we need to calculate his age in 1980. To do this, we subtract his birth year from 1980.
6. 1980 - 1954 = 26
7. Therefore, Jeelani was 26 years old when he first played for the Dallas Mavericks.

","To find out how old Max Aaron was when he began skating, we need to follow these steps:

1.  Find the birthdate of Max Aaron: 
    We can find Max Aaron's birthdate in the ""Personal information"" section of the table. It is listed as February 25, 1992.

2.  Find the year Max Aaron began skating:
    Max Aaron began skating in 1996, which we can find in the ""Began skating"" section of the table.

3.  Calculate the age of Max Aaron when he began skating:
    Since Max Aaron's birthdate is February 25, 1992, and he began skating in 1996, we need to subtract his birth year from the year he began skating. However, since his birth year is in the same decade as the year he began skating, we need to consider the exact date of birth.

    If we assume that Max Aaron began skating on the first day of 1996 (which is unlikely), we can subtract 1996 - 1992 = 4 years.

    However, since the problem is asking for his age in a specific year (1996), we can calculate his age as follows:

However, we also need to consider the months. Since Benny McCoy was born on November 9, 1915, and made his debut on September 14, 1938, he would have been 23 years old when his debut month and year would have been 23 years since his birth month and year, and since his birth date was in November, we must subtract 1 from "

","A: Let’s think step by step.

Step 1: We need to find out when Mohammad Yamin became the Minister of National Education.
From the table, we can see that he held this position from 30 July 1953 to 12 August 1955.

Step 2: We need to find out Mohammad Yamin's birthdate.
From the table, we can see that he was born on 24 August 1903.

Step 3: We need to calculate Mohammad Yamin's age when he became the Minister of National Education in 1953.
To do this, we will subtract his birth year from the year he became the Minister, which is 1953.

Age = 1953 - 1903 = 50 years old.

However, we need to account for the fact that he became Minister in July 1953, while his birthdate is in August. This means he was already 50 years old by the end of 1952 and turned 51 in August 1953. Therefore, when he became Minister of National Education in July 1953, he was 50 years old.

Since his birth month and day are not specified, we can only use his birth year to estimate his age. Assuming he was born on the first day of August, his age would be:

1913 - 1877 = 36 years

However, since his birth month is not specified, we can't be certain about the exact date of his birth. But for the sake of calculation, we'll assume he was born on the first day of August.

","To find the answer, let's break down the information provided in the table.

1. We are looking for the age of Sam Snead when he turned professional.
2. The table mentions that Sam Snead turned professional in 1934.
3. We also find that Sam Snead died on May 23, 2002, at the age of 89.
4. To find his age when he turned professional, we need to subtract the year he turned professional (1934) from the year he was born.

Unfortunately, the table does not provide Sam Snead's birth year directly. However, we can calculate his birth year by subtracting his age at death (89) from the year of his death (2002).

Birth year = Year of death - Age at death
Birth year = 2002 - 89
Birth year = 1913

Now that we have Sam Snead's birth year (1913), we can find his age when he turned professional in 1934.

Age at turning professional = Birth year - Year of turning professional
Age at turning professional = 1913 - 1934
Age at turning professional = 21

1. Find Stephen Hawking's date of birth.
2. Find Stephen Hawking's date of death.
3. Calculate the difference between the two dates to find his age at the time of death.

From the table, we can see that Stephen Hawking was born on January 8, 1942. His date of death is mentioned as March 14, 2018.

Now, let's calculate his age at the time of death:
- Year of death: 2018
- Year of birth: 1942
- Difference in years: 2018 - 1942 = 76 years

However, since his birthday is on January 8th and he died on March 14th, we need to subtract 1 from the total years to find his age.

So, Stephen Hawking's age at the time of death is 76 years.

","To answer the question, let's break down the steps:

1. First, we need to find the year Stephen Hawking was awarded the BBVA Foundation Frontiers of Knowledge Award, which is given in the table as 2015.

2. Next, we need to find the year Stephen Hawking was born, which is given in the table as 1942.

3. Then, we need to calculate the age of Stephen Hawking when he was awarded the BBVA Foundation Frontiers of Knowledge Award in 2015. To do this, we subtract his birth year from the year he was awarded the prize. 

Age = Year of award - Year of birth
Age = 2015 - 1942
Age = 73

Therefore, Stephen Hawking was 73 years old when he was awarded the BBVA Foundation Frontiers of Knowledge Award in 2015.

Final Answer: The final answer is 73."

","To find out how old Steve Austin was when he originally retired from professional wrestling, we need to follow these steps:

1. Find the date of Steve Austin's original retirement from professional wrestling.
   The table states that Steve Austin originally retired on March 30, 2003.

2. Find the date of Steve Austin's birth.
   The table states that Steve Austin was born on December 18, 1964.

3. Calculate the age of Steve Austin at the time of his original retirement.
   To do this, we need to find the difference between the year of his retirement and the year of his birth. 
   The year of his retirement is 2003, and the year of his birth is 1964. 
   So, the difference is 2003 - 1964 = 39 years.

4. Since Steve Austin retired in 2003, we also need to account for the year of his birth.

2. Find Thiago Alves' birthdate.
3. Calculate his age at the time of winning the gold medal.

Step 1: Identify the year Thiago Alves won the gold medal in the Pan American Games.
The table shows that Thiago Alves won the gold medal in the Pan American Games in 2011.

Step 2: Find Thiago Alves' birthdate.
According to the table, Thiago Alves was born on July 26, 1986.

Step 3: Calculate his age at the time of winning the gold medal.
To find Thiago Alves' age in 2011, we need to subtract his birth year from 2011. 
2011 - 1986 = 25

However, since Thiago Alves won the gold medal in 2011, we need to consider the year he turned 25, which is 1986 + 25 = 2011. 
But since the question asks for his age in 2011, we need to consider the year before that which is 2010 but that is not relevant"

","To answer this question, we need to determine Thomas Eakins' age at the time of his death. 

Step 1: We need to find the date of Thomas Eakins' death, which is already provided in the table as June 25, 1916.

Step 2: We also need to find the date of Thomas Eakins' birth, which is provided in the table as July 25, 1844.

Step 3: Now, we need to calculate the difference in years between the two dates to determine Thomas Eakins' age at the time of his death. We can do this by subtracting the year of birth from the year of death: 1916 - 1844 = 72.

Step 4: However, since Thomas Eakins was born in July and died in June, we need to consider whether he had his birthday yet in the year of his death. Since his birthday is in July, it would not have occurred yet in the year of his death. Therefore, we do not need to add an extra year to our calculation.

Step 5: Therefore, Thomas Eakins was 72 years old when he died.

2. Determine the age of Tony Stewart at the time of his first NASCAR Cup Series win.
   - Tony Stewart was born on May 20, 1971.
   - His first NASCAR Cup Series win was in 1999.
   - Therefore, he was 28 years old in 1999.

3. Now, we need to find the age of Tony Stewart when he won his first NASCAR Cup Series race in 2002.
   - The table states that Tony Stewart won the NASCAR Cup Series in 2002.
   - To find his age, we need to subtract his birth year from 2002.
   - However, we know that he won his first NASCAR Cup Series in 1999, so we need to calculate his age at the time of the 2002 win, which would be his age in 2002 minus his age in 1999.

","To answer this question, we need to follow these steps:

1. Identify the event where Wang Xiaoli won her first gold medal at the Asian Junior Championships in 2006.
2. Find the year she was born.
3. Calculate her age when she won the gold medal.

From the table, we can see that Wang Xiaoli won her first gold medal at the Asian Junior Championships in 2006. 

Next, we need to find the year she was born. According to the table, Wang Xiaoli was born on June 24, 1989.

Now, we can calculate her age when she won the gold medal. Since she won the gold medal in 2006, we need to subtract her birth year from the year she won the gold medal. 

2006 (year of winning the gold medal) - 1989 (birth year) = 17

However, we also need to consider the month and day of her birth. Since she won the gold medal in 2006 and was born in June 1989, we need to calculate her age as of the year 2006.

2006 (year of winning the gold medal) - 1989 (birth year) = 17

","To find out how old Watanjar was when he took office as Minister of Defence, we need to determine the dates of his two terms as Minister of Defence and then calculate his age at the start of each term.

First, let's identify the dates of Watanjar's two terms as Minister of Defence:

1. First term: April 1979 - 28 July 1979
2. Second term: 6 March 1990 - April 1992

Now, let's calculate his age at the start of each term:

1. To find his age at the start of the first term, we need to know the exact date of his birth. According to the table, Watanjar was born in 1946. Assuming he was born in 1946, we can calculate his age in 1979. Since he was born in 1946, he was 33 years old in 1979.

2. To find his age at the start of the second term, we need to calculate the difference between the year of his birth and the year of his second term. According to the table, his second term started in 1990. Therefore, we can calculate his age in 1990 by subtracting 1946 from"

","To find out how old Babe Young was when he made his MLB debut, we need to follow these steps:

1. First, we need to find the date of Babe Young's MLB debut, which is given as September 26, 1936.
2. Next, we need to find Babe Young's birthdate, which is given as July 1, 1915.
3. Then, we need to calculate the age of Babe Young at the time of his MLB debut by subtracting his birth year from the year of his debut.
4. Finally, we need to account for the month and day difference between his birthdate and debut date to find the exact age.

Let's calculate:

- Year of birth: 1915
- Year of debut: 1936
- Age at debut (year difference): 1936 - 1915 = 21 years

Since his birthdate is July 1, and his debut date is September 26, we need to account for the 2 months and 25 days difference.

- 2 months: 21 years (age at debut) - 2 months = 20 years and 8 months

","To find the answer, we need to follow these steps:

1. Identify the year Zumla won the Mahathir Science Award.
2. Determine Zumla's birth year.
3. Calculate his age at the time of winning the award.

From the table, we can see that:
- Zumla won the Mahathir Science Award in 2020.
- His birth year is 1955.

Now, let's calculate his age in 2020:
2020 (year of winning the award) - 1955 (birth year) = 65 years old.

However, the table also mentions that Zumla is currently 67 years old as of December 2022.

Since the question asks for his age when he won the award, we need to consider the year 2020. But the table does not provide the exact age at that time. However, based on the information provided, we can infer that he was likely 65 years old in 2020.

Step 1: Identify the relevant information in the table. We are looking for Adolf von Baeyer's age at the time of marriage.

Step 2: Find the date of Adolf von Baeyer's marriage. According to the table, he married Adelheid Bendemann in 1868.

Step 3: Find Adolf von Baeyer's birthdate. According to the table, he was born on 31 October 1835.

Step 4: Calculate Adolf von Baeyer's age at the time of marriage. To do this, we need to subtract his birth year from the year he got married. Since he got married in 1868, we subtract 1835 from 1868 to get 33.

However, this calculation does not take into account the month and day of birth. Since he was born in October 1835, we need to consider whether he was married in the same year or the following year.

Step 5: Determine the year of marriage in relation to the birth year. Since he was born in 1835 and got married in 1868, he was indeed married in a different year. However, we must consider the month of birth, which is October.

","A: Let's think step by step.

Step 1: Identify the relevant information about Adolf von Baeyer's Nobel Prize. 
From the table, we can see that Adolf von Baeyer won the Nobel Prize for Chemistry in the year 1905.

Step 2: Find Adolf von Baeyer's birthdate. 
His birthdate is mentioned in the table as 31 October 1835.

Step 3: Calculate Adolf von Baeyer's age when he won the Nobel Prize. 
To find his age in 1905, we need to subtract his birth year from 1905. 
1905 - 1835 = 70.

However, since he was born in 1835 and the prize was awarded in 1905, we should also consider the year he was born in the calculation.

Step 4: Since he was born in 1835, we should consider his age in the year 1905, not the year of his birth.
So, we need to calculate his age from his birth year to 1905.

1905 - 1835 = 70 years old at the start of 1905, however he won the prize in 1905 so we must subtract one year from 70.

","To answer the question, let's break it down into steps.

Step 1: Identify the date of the 2020 Myanmar general election results.
The question doesn't explicitly mention the date of the 2020 general election. However, based on the information provided, we know that the 2021 Myanmar Spring Revolution took place from 2 February 2021 - present. This suggests that the 2020 general election likely occurred before 2021.

Step 2: Find the date of the 2020 Myanmar general election.
Unfortunately, the table doesn't provide the exact date of the 2020 general election. However, we can infer that the election occurred in 2020, as it's mentioned that the revolution is seeking ""Recognition of the 2020 general election results.""

Step 3: Determine the date of the 2008 Constitution adoption.

","To find the age of the church when it initially closed, we need to determine the year it was built and the year it was closed.

1. First, let's find the year the church was built. According to the table, the church was ""Founded"" in the 13th century. Since the 13th century ranges from 1201 to 1300, we can't pinpoint the exact year. However, for the purpose of this calculation, we'll assume the church was built around the midpoint of the 13th century, which is approximately 1250.

2. Next, let's find the year the church was closed. According to the table, the church was ""Closed"" from 1873 to 1949. This means it was closed for 76 years.

3. Now, let's calculate the age of the church when it initially closed. If we assume the church was built around 1250, we can subtract the year it was closed (1873) from the assumed construction year (1250) to find the age of the church when it closed.

","To determine how old the church was when it was consecrated, we need to find the year it was consecrated and the year it was founded.

1. The table mentions that the church was ""Founded"" in the ""13th century"". This means the exact year is not given, but we can estimate it to be between 1201 and 1300.
2. The table also mentions that the church was ""Consecrated"" on ""31 July 1949"". This is the year we need to focus on to find the age of the church at that time.

Since we don't have the exact founding year, we can use the estimated range of 1201-1300. Let's consider the year 1250 as a rough estimate for the founding year.

Now, let's calculate the age of the church when it was consecrated in 1949:

- If the church was founded in 1250, it would be approximately 699 years old in 1949.

However, since the question asks for the age of the church when it was consecrated, we need to consider the year of consecration (1949) as the reference point.

","To find Percy Faith's age if he had died three months later in 1976, we need to follow these steps:

1. Find the month and year of Percy Faith's death, which is February 1976.
2. Add three months to February 1976. Since we are adding three months, we will be in May 1976.
3. Determine the day of the month that Percy Faith was born, which is April 7, 1908.
4. Since Percy Faith was born in April, and we are calculating his age in May 1976, we need to consider the age he would have been if he had lived until May 1976. This means we will be counting the year of birth (1908) as the first year of his life, and the age will increase by one for each subsequent year.
5. Calculate the number of years from Percy Faith's birth year (1908) to the year of his hypothetical death (1976). This is 1976 - 1908 = 68 years.
6. Since we are considering the age at the end of the year, we do not need to add any additional months to the year, but we do need to account for the day of birth in the calculation"

","To determine how many years a judge can serve before a five-year extension is required, we need to consider their age at appointment and the judge term length.

1. The judge is appointed at the age of 50.
2. According to the table, a judge can serve until they are 75 years old.
3. To find the number of years the judge can serve before a five-year extension is required, we need to subtract their age at appointment from their maximum service age and then subtract the five-year extension period.
4. Subtracting the age at appointment (50) from the maximum service age (75) gives us 75 - 50 = 25 years.
5. Since the five-year extension can be repeated indefinitely, we do not need to subtract the extension period from the total years of service.

However, the question asks for the years before a five-year extension is required. Therefore, we consider the period before the first five-year extension, which is the maximum service age minus the age at appointment.

Final Answer: The judge can serve for 25 years before a five-year extension is required."

","To find out in how many months Gorshkova will turn 34, we need to calculate the time difference between her current age and 34.

Step 1: Determine Gorshkova's current age.
Gorshkova's current age is 33 years old, as mentioned in the table.

Step 2: Calculate the time difference between her current age and 34.
Since Gorshkova is currently 33 years old, she will turn 34 in 1 year.

Step 3: Convert the time difference into months.
There are 12 months in a year. Therefore, 1 year is equal to 12 months.

Final Answer: The final answer is 12."

2. Identify the year when Italian Eritrea was established.
3. Calculate the difference between the two years to find the number of years.

From the table, we can see that the Ethiopian Empire monarchy was abolished on 21 March 1975.

Now, let's find the year when Italian Eritrea was established. From the table, we can see that Italian Eritrea was established in 1890.

Now, we can calculate the difference between the two years:

1975 (abolition year) - 1890 (Italian Eritrea establishment year) = 85 years

Therefore, Italian Eritrea happened 85 years before the Ethiopian Empire monarchy was abolished.

","To find the date on which Max Aaron turned 30, we need to follow these steps:

1.  Identify Max Aaron's birthdate from the table. The birthdate is given as February 25, 1992.

2.  Calculate the date that is 30 years after his birthdate. To do this, we need to add 30 years to the birthdate.

3.  Since the current year is 2022, we can calculate the date as follows: February 25, 2022 + 30 years = February 25, 2052.

However, the question is asking for the date on which Max Aaron turned 30, which means we need to find the date 30 years after his birthdate but before 2022.

4.  To find the date on which Max Aaron turned 30, we can subtract 30 years from the current year (2022). This will give us the year in which he turned 30.

5.  Since we already know Max Aaron's birthdate, we can then add 30 years to his birthdate to find the exact date on which he turned 30.

6.  Subtract 30 years from the current year: 2022 - 30 = 1992"

","To find out how many years Antonio Mohamed played for the national team, we need to follow these steps:

1. Look for the section in the table that corresponds to Antonio Mohamed's national team career. This section is titled ""National team"".

2. Within the ""National team"" section, we find two entries:
   - 1989 | Argentina U20 | 2 | (0)
   - 1991 | Argentina | 4 | (1)

3. Since we are interested in Antonio Mohamed's career with the senior national team, we focus on the entry ""1991 | Argentina | 4 | (1)"".

4. The entry indicates that Antonio Mohamed played for the Argentina national team in the year 1991.

5. However, we also see that in 1989, he played for the Argentina U20 team, which is not the senior national team.

6. Given that there is only one entry for the senior national team, we can conclude that Antonio Mohamed played for the national team for 1 year.

","To determine the number of years Emmitt Smith played for the Dallas Cowboys, we need to look at the ""Career history"" section of the table, which lists his teams and the years he played for them.

1. The ""Career history"" section lists the teams Emmitt Smith played for, including the Dallas Cowboys and the Arizona Cardinals.
2. We are specifically interested in the years he played for the Dallas Cowboys.
3. According to the table, Emmitt Smith played for the Dallas Cowboys from 1990 to 2002.
4. To find the number of years, we need to subtract the starting year from the ending year: 2002 - 1990 = 12

However, since the question asks for the number of years played for the Cowboys, we need to consider the entire period, which is 13 years, but since he played in the 2002 season, we count it as 2002-1990 which is 13 years, but he played in 1990 so it is 13 years."

Step 1: Identify the years Zidane played in his senior career. The years are listed in the first column of the table.

Step 2: The years listed are: 1989-1992, 1992-1996, 1996-2001, and 2001-2006.

Step 3: To find the total number of years, we need to subtract the starting year of the first period from the ending year of the last period and then add 1.

Step 4: The starting year of the first period is 1989, and the ending year of the last period is 2006.

Step 5: Subtracting the starting year from the ending year gives us 2006 - 1989 = 17.

Step 6: Adding 1 to the result gives us 17 + 1 = 18.

However, the above method assumes that the player played for each team for the entire duration mentioned. But the problem statement asks for the total years of senior career, not the total years of playing for each team.

","To determine over how many years Dwayne Johnson was an active wrestler, we need to find the time period during which he was active in wrestling. This information is provided in the ""Years active"" section of the table.

The years active for wrestling are given as: 1996-2004; 2011-2013; 2016.

Now, we need to calculate the number of years covered by these ranges. 

1. The range 1996-2004 covers 9 years (2004 - 1996 + 1 = 9).
2. The range 2011-2013 covers 3 years (2013 - 2011 + 1 = 3).
3. The range 2016 is a single year.

To find the total number of years, we add the years covered by each range: 9 + 3 + 1 = 13.

However, we also need to consider that there might be a gap between the last year of the first range and the first year of the second range, and between the last year of the second range and the third year. Since there are no gaps, we can directly add the years.

Therefore, Dwayne Johnson was an active wrestler for 13 years.

","To find the difference in years between the planned and elapsed time of the Orbiter Mission duration, we need to first identify the planned and elapsed time.

The planned duration of the Orbiter is given as ~ 7.5 years.

The elapsed time is given as 2 years, 10 months. To convert this into years, we can convert the months to years. There are 12 months in a year, so 10 months is equivalent to 10/12 = 0.83 years (approximately).

Therefore, the elapsed time is 2 + 0.83 = 2.83 years.

Now, to find the difference between the planned and elapsed time, we subtract the elapsed time from the planned time:

Planned time: 7.5 years
Elapsed time: 2.83 years

Difference = Planned time - Elapsed time
= 7.5 years - 2.83 years
= 4.67 years

However, rounding up to the nearest whole number, the difference is 5 years.

Final Answer: The final answer is 5."

","To answer this question, we need to determine the number of years between the Space Shuttle's first flight and its first crewed flight.

Step 1: Identify the date of the Space Shuttle's first flight.
The first flight occurred on August 12, 1977.

Step 2: Identify the date of the Space Shuttle's first crewed flight.
The first crewed flight occurred on April 12, 1981.

Step 3: Calculate the difference in years between the two dates.

","To answer the question, we need to find the age of Paul Gauguin at the time of his death.

Step 1: We need to find the date of Paul Gauguin's death.
From the table, we can see that Paul Gauguin died on 8 May 1903.

From the table, we can see that Paul Gauguin was born on 7 June 1848.

Step 3: We need to calculate the age of Paul Gauguin at the time of his death.
To do this, we will subtract his birth year from his death year and then subtract the difference in months.

Step 4: Calculate the age.
Paul Gauguin died in 1903 and was born in 1848, so he died 55 years after his birth. 

However, we need to consider the months. Paul Gauguin died in May 1903, and was born in June 1848. So he was 54 years old when he died.

Dolly Parton concert chronology

Backwoods Barbie Tour | (2008) | Better Day World Tour | (2011) | Blue Smoke World Tour | (2014)

","To find the average length of time between Dolly Parton's tours in years, we need to determine the duration of each tour and then calculate the differences between the start dates of each tour.

From the table, we can see that the tours are listed in chronological order, along with their start dates:

1. Backwoods Barbie Tour (2008)
2. Better Day World Tour (2011)
3. Blue Smoke World Tour (2014)

The duration of each tour is not explicitly mentioned, but we can assume that the duration is the time between the start date and the next tour's start date.

To calculate the differences, we need to subtract the start dates:

- Between Backwoods Barbie Tour (2008) and Better Day World Tour (2011): 2011 - 2008 = 3 years
- Between Better Day World Tour (2011) and Blue Smoke World Tour (2014): 2014 - 2011 = 3 years

Since there are only two intervals between the three tours, we can calculate the average length of time by taking the average of these two intervals:

(3 years + 3 years) / 2 = 6 / 2 = 3 years

","To find the total number of years that the Space Shuttle program lasted, we need to determine the duration of the program. 

Step 1: Identify the start and end years of the program.
The first flight of the Space Shuttle program was on August 12, 1977 (ALT-12), and the last flight was on July 21, 2011 (STS-135).

Step 2: Calculate the duration of the program.
To find the duration, we need to subtract the start year from the end year.

Step 3: Perform the calculation.
End year: 2011
Start year: 1977
Duration = End year - Start year = 2011 - 1977 = 34 years

However, since the program started in 1972, not 1977, we need to recalculate the duration.
End year: 2011
Start year: 1972
Duration = End year - Start year = 2011 - 1972 = 39 years

Therefore, the Space Shuttle program lasted for 39 years.

However, the Vikram lander's duration is specified as 0 days due to a landing failure. Since the question is asking for the difference between planned and elapsed time, we can't calculate the difference for the Vikram lander directly from the information given. However, we can calculate the difference for the orbiter and note that the Vikram lander's planned duration is not relevant since it failed to land.

","To find the longest span between championships in Cricket ODI for Australia, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Identify the years of Cricket ODI championships**: From the table, we see that Australia won the Cricket ODI championship in the years 1987, 1999, 2003, 2007, and 2015.

2. **Find the longest span between championships**: We need to find the difference between the years of consecutive championships. 

   - 1999 - 1987 = 12 years (between 1999 and 1987)
   - 2003 - 1999 = 4 years (between 2003 and 1999)
   - 2007 - 2003 = 4 years (between 2007 and 2003)
   - 2015 - 2007 = 8 years (between 2015 and 2007)

   We can see that the longest span is between 1987 and 1999, which is 12 years.

3. **Determine if there are any longer spans**: We also need to check if there are any longer spans between the championships. Since we have found the longest span between consecutive championships, we can conclude that it is"

","To answer the question, we need to follow these steps:

1. Identify the relevant section of the table that contains information about Stéphane Antiga's achievements.
2. Within this section, find the specific achievement that involves a silver medal.
3. Check if the location of the achievement is mentioned, specifically looking for Moscow.
4. If we find a match, note the year associated with this achievement.

Let's apply these steps:

1. The relevant section of the table is ""CEV European Championship"" under the ""Men's volleyball"" category.
2. Within this section, we find the following achievements:
   - 'Silver medal - second place | 2003 Germany'
   - 'Silver medal - second place | 2009 Turkey'
3. Since we are looking for an achievement in Moscow, we can see that neither 2003 Germany nor 2009 Turkey matches our criteria.
4. However, we also need to check the ""CEV European Championship"" under the ""Men's volleyball"" category for other locations, but there is no information about Moscow. We also need to check the other sections of the table, specifically ""Head Coach | Poland"" and ""Head Coach | Canada"", but there is no information about Moscow either.

3. The row with the key ""Publication"" is likely to have the information we need.
4. The value associated with the key ""Publication"" is ""Q4 2016"".

Since ""Q4 2016"" refers to the fourth quarter of 2016, it means the game was published in 2016.

However, the question asks for the first time you could play the game, which might imply the release date. Since the game was published in Q4 2016, the first time you could play the game would also be in 2016.

","To determine the year the Satish Dhawan Space Centre was named, we need to analyze the information provided in the table.

1. The table does not directly mention the year the Satish Dhawan Space Centre was named. However, it does mention the launch history of the centre, including the first launch, which was SLV / Rohini RS-1 on 9 August 1979.
2. It is likely that the centre was named before the first launch, but we cannot confirm this from the given information.
3. The table does not provide a specific answer to the question, so we cannot determine the year the centre was named.

However, based on general knowledge, the Satish Dhawan Space Centre was named after Satish Dhawan, a renowned Indian aerospace engineer, and scientist. He was the Chairman of the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) from 1972 to 1984. It is likely that the centre was named in his honour during his tenure as Chairman.

Therefore, without a direct answer from the table, we can only make an educated guess based on general knowledge.

Final Answer: The final answer is not explicitly stated in the table, but it is likely that the Satish Dhawan Space Centre was named during Satish Dhawan"

","To answer the question, we need to analyze the given table and find any information related to the movie ""Zoe Jane"".

Step 1: Identify the relevant section of the table that might contain information about the movie ""Zoe Jane"". 
We see that there is a section called ""Singles from |  14 Shades of Grey"" which lists songs from the album ""14 Shades of Grey"".

Died	February 9, 1976 | (1976-02-09) |  (aged 67) | Encino, California, U.S.
Occupation(s)	Bandleader, orchestrator, composer

","To determine Percy Faith's age in 1949, we need to follow these steps:

1. First, we need to find Percy Faith's birth year, which is given as 1908.
2. Since we are looking for his age in 1949, we need to calculate the difference between 1949 and his birth year (1908).
3. We can do this by subtracting his birth year from 1949: 1949 - 1908 = 41.
4. Therefore, Percy Faith was 41 years old in 1949.
